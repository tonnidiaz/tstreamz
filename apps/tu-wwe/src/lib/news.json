But other times, no matter how much an organization's decision-makers ignore a performer, they find their way to the main event anyway.</p>\n<p>There was <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/3962508/cm-punk\">CM Punk</a> during his run with WWE, a plucky wrestler smaller than his main event cohorts, but won over crowds with his biting mic skills and daredevil style inside the ropes.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/17443817/wwe-profile-page-daniel-bryan\">Daniel Bryan</a> followed, an undersized underdog who wasn't coveted by WWE officials but willed his way to the headline spot with incredible technical wrestling and an uncanny connection with the crowd.</p>\n<p>Jade Cargill, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/29125761/wwe-profile-page-bianca-belair\">Bianca Belair</a>, MJF and many others have broken out over the years, pushing their way to the top through sheer talent, determination and constant improvement.</p>\n<p><alsosee></p>\n<p>But 2023 has undoubtedly been the year of <i><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/34918696/wwe-profile-page-la-knight\">L ... A ... Knight</a> ... Yeah!</i> He crashes the ESPN Pro Wrestling Power Rankings ahead of Saturday, when he'll challenge wrestling's top star, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/17122948/wwe-profile-page-roman-reigns\">Roman Reigns</a>, for the WWE Undisputed Universal Championship at <a href=\"https://preview.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/27859283/wwe-crown-jewel-2023-news-stories-match-card-results-start-information\">Crown Jewel</a> in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia (1 p.m. ET, Peacock).</p>\n<p>Where do pro wrestling's top women, me and tag teams stand in the ESPN Power Rankings? More importantly, which ranked wrestlers have seen their star rise the most? Mike Coppinger, Arda Ocal and Marc Raimondi take a look.</p>\n<p><em>(Editor's note: ESPN's voting panel consisted of Marc Raimondi, Kendall K. Howard, Cheyenne Leeman, Andreas Hale, Marc Raimondi, Sach Chandan, Terrance Williams and Eddie Maisonet.)</em></p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<h2>IYO SKY is flying high</h2>\n<p><photo1></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Raimondi:</strong> IYO SKY has been on the shortlist of the very best women's wrestlers in the world for about a decade. As Io Shirai in Japan's World Wonder Ring Stardom promotion, the incredibly gifted high-flyer was putting on mind-blowing matches years ago with the likes of Kairi Sane (then Kairi Hojo), Mayu Iwatani and Meiko Satomura. Shirai was the ace of Stardom and, along with Hojo and Iwatani, helped the organization get off the ground and grow into the best all-women's promotion in the world, where it stands currently.</p>\n<p><inline1-wide></p>\n<p>SKY's best run in WWE before this year was as the NXT women's champion during the pandemic with no or few fans in the crowd. She had some memorable moments, like doing a moonsault with a garbage can over her head off the top of the cage during War Games, but that was mostly it. Sure, SKY and Dakota Kai had solid matches as WWE women's tag team champs in 2022, as well. SKY did well with everything WWE had for her creatively, despite not being able to speak English perfectly, but it seemed like there was a ceiling over her head.</p>\n<p>Until this year. Something changed in the spring. Maybe it was the match against Bianca Belair at WWE Backlash. The fans in Puerto Rico got behind SKY, though she was the heel, against the ultra-babyface Belair inexplicably. Seemingly, WWE enthusiasts were ready to see the reins come off, to see what SKY could do. She did not win that match or the title at the time, but less than two months later, she took the Money in the Bank briefcase and then cashed in on Belair at SummerSlam to become WWE women's champion for the first time.</p>\n<p>SKY had a great singles match on SmackDown against Asuka in September and has had solid performances in matches against Charlotte Flair, including a triple threat with the two of them and Asuka. Next up with Belair again, Saturday at Crown Jewel in a rematch of perhaps SKY's best match on the WWE main roster. If the last few months are any indication, fans should expect something special.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<h2>L.A. Knight is overlooked no more</h2>\n<p><photo2></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Coppinger:</strong> CM Punk and Daniel Bryan were overlooked in WWE, in part, because they were undersized compared to the leading men Vince McMahon is known to prefer: bodybuilder types like Hulk Hogan, The Rock and John Cena.</p>\n<p>For Knight, looks were never the issue. Nonetheless, it took him until age 40 to truly break out. Knight didn't even begin 2022 as Knight, but Max Dupri, a manager and talent agent for the comedy tag-team Maximum Male Models.</p>\n<p><inline2-wide></p>\n<p>When he finally ditched the gimmick last October, returning to his <em>braggadocious</em> NXT character, Knight truly was on the path to the sort of mega-stardom he always talks about in promos.</p>\n<p>Wrestlers usually emerged from programs with the late, great Bray Wyatt worse off. Not Knight. He used the feud with the supernatural Wyatt as a springboard, showcasing his larger-than-life persona, underrated in-ring skills and, of course, catchphrases.</p>\n<p>A throwback to WWE's Attitude Era, Knight was still not being pushed when 2023 began. Slowly but surely, the crowd began to cheer for Knight, even though he played the heel. It became apparently just how popular Knight was when WWE was in Los Angeles for WrestleMania in April. The pops were boisterous for \"The Megastar,\" who won the Andre the Giant Memorial Battle Royal that weekend.</p>\n<p>The chants only grew louder from there. They even chanted his name in Saudi Arabia when Knight wasn't on the card.</p>\n<p>And now, coming off a tag-team victory alongside John Cena against The Bloodline, Knight is poised for his biggest star turn yet, a bout against Roman Reigns for the biggest prize in WWE.</p>\n<p>No one could have seen this coming when the year started, not even Knight himself, who outpaced Cena in merchandise sales for the month of October. Imagine that.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<h2>MJF and Adam Cole find a new way to reinvent themselves</h2>\n<p><photo3></p>\n<p><strong>Ocal:</strong> It would be an easy choice to pick MJF and Adam Cole as the tag team that has most impressed since the start of the year - they weren't a tag team at the start of 2023. In fact, when the team started together in the summer, more wrestling fans were wondering if this would simply be a vessel to get them to a marquee singles match instead of their development as a legitimate tag team. Turns out it was both.</p>\n<p><inline3-wide></p>\n<p>The MJF-Adam Cole saga has been beautiful. The storytelling has on point, and it has felt like these two, at the top of their game, have hit every single beat out of the park. They are, after all, two of the best pro wrestlers on the planet today.</p>\n<p>All In 2023 at Wembley Stadium was all the proof you need to solidify that this works not only as a singles rivalry but as a long-term tag team. <i>Better Than You Bay Bay</i> opened the event by winning the ROH tag team championships. Then, a half-hour title match to close the show with MJF on top. Wrestling fans got to see more of both, even if the tag team and the singles rivalry can co-exist (even if on hold due to Cole's injuries) only for so long.</p>\n<p>These two performers are versatile in the best ways -- put them in any situation, any scenario, with any talent, and they will find ways to thrive. That's what you ask for in pro wrestlers. Make yourself look good and elevate those around you. We're not in those conversations behind the scenes, but it just feels like these two, in particular, have that paradigm -- how can we make the best thing possible and everyone takes a step up? Those are the kind of people wrestlers want to work with and wrestling fans want to watch. It's paying dividends on screen.</p>\n\n\n\n\n",

        "story": "<p><video1></p>\n<p>Ric Flair is back on the professional wrestling scene with AEW as of last week. That doesn't mean the legendary \"Nature Boy\" is gearing up for one last match. Not that he wouldn't be willing.</p>\n<p>\"I'm up for it,\" the 74-year-old Flair told ESPN. \"But they won't let that happen.\"</p>\n<p>Flair said he recently signed a deal with AEW, though he is unsure how often he will appear on television and pay-per-view events. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AEW/status/1720158182096478644\">AEW announced that Flair's signing</a> with the promotion would be a multiyear deal. In addition to that on-screen contract, Flair's Wooooo! Energy drink is the official energy drink sponsor of AEW. That announcement was made on Thursday. Flair also has his own marijuana product called Ric Flair Drip, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/38163503/ric-flair-drip-offset\">a takeoff on the song by rappers Offset and Metro Boomin</a>.</p>\n<p>\"Ric cemented his legacy as one of the greatest professional wrestlers of all-time long ago,\" AEW CEO Tony Khan said in an announcement. \"And now his world-renowned persona and his amazing wrestling mind will be major assets to AEW's programming and our position globally.\"</p>\n<p><alsosee></p>\n<p>In his new role with AEW, Flair has been positioned alongside Sting, his longtime friend and former wrestling rival. Sting (Steve Borden), 64, announced last month that he would be retiring from the ring in March 2024. Flair will be involved in the farewell tour.</p>\n\n\n<p>Over the last three years with AEW, Sting has pulled off some daredevil-like feats, especially for someone his age. He has jumped off balconies and ladders, and been put through tables. Flair said even if he doesn't have a last match, he would like to take at least \"one more bump.\" Flair said if AEW wants him to go through a table, he would do it.</p>\n<p>\"You can't be a manager and not take bumps,\" Flair said. \"It just doesn't make sense. You gotta be able to feed and jump in and move around. And I do all that. I train hard, so we'll see. I'm up for anything.\"</p>\n<p>In 2017, Flair suffered a ruptured intestine kidney failure, and he became septic with his body fighting off infection. He suffered from heart failure and infection. Flair was on life support for two weeks, and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/34297366/why-ric-flair-73-step-ring-one-last\">he told ESPN last year</a> that he was given only a 15% chance of survival. He then had four heart surgeries and had a pacemaker installed in 2018.</p>\n<p><photo1></p>\n<p>Last year, Flair had what he said at the time would be his last match, a tag team clash with his son-in-law <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/23406227/wwe-profile-page-andrade-cien-almas\">Andrade El Idolo</a> against Jeff Jarrett and Jay Lethal. Flair passed out multiple times during the match, though <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/34326246/ric-flair-73-handles-pressure-authors-classic-performance-winning-final-wrestling-match\">he was able to finish it</a>. Flair said he got dehydrated during the match because he didn't drink enough water beforehand.</p>\n<p>Other than some risky stunts, Flair has other desires for his time in AEW. He'd like to manage Andrade, who is married to Flair's daughter <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/17165125/wwe-profile-page-charlotte-flair\">Charlotte</a>, a WWE star. He would also like to have a \"promo battle\" in the ring with MJF, the AEW champion and, at 27 years old, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/38118887/from-mjf-rhea-ripley-toel-hijo-del-vikingo-professional-wrestling-30-30\">the best young wrestler in the world</a>.</p>\n<p>\"Let's see what you got, kid,\" Flair said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n",

        "story": "<p><photo1></p>\n<p>One of the biggest professional wrestling superstars of all time has joined All Elite Wrestling. Adam Copeland, formerly known as <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/28635367/wwe-profile-page-edge\">Edge</a> in WWE, has signed with AEW and made his debut on Sunday night at AEW's WrestleDream 2023. He'll be known as the Rated R Superstar Adam Copeland.</p>\n<p>\"Adam Copeland has officially signed with AEW,\" President of All Elite Wrestling Tony Khan said on Sunday night. \"Something I'm really excited about. Something that's going to really set us apart. ... This is full time. Adan is going to be with us every week. He's a full-time part of the AEW roster.\"</p>\n<p>Copeland, 49, with his established Metalingus song (but had a new intro) came out for the save on Sunday night as Christian Cage, a longtime partner of Copeland WWE, was about to hit Sting with a Con-Chair-To. Copeland entered the ring, took the chair from Christian and after feigning that he would attack Sting, hit Nick Wayne. As Cage rolled out of the ring, Copeland hit Luchasaurus and Wayne with spears. He then shook hands with Darby Allin and Sting.</p>\n<p><inline1></p>\n<p>\"Part of coming here is that I wanted to contribute,\" Copeland said at the post-event media conference. \"I wanted to help. I just felt like here I really would be able to do that, to have the opportunity to do that. I look at an entire fresh roster of faces and so many talent that I've never laid hands on before, and that to me, as a person who is driven by challenges, that was the biggest thing. I've never been in a ring with Samoa Joe. I've never stood in the ring with Sting before tonight. After 31 years in the industry that's never happened.\"</p>\n<p>Copeland had done it all in his run with WWE. He was an 11-time world champion, five-time Intercontinental champion, United States champion and 13-time tag team champion. He won the Royal Rumble, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/34167429/wwe-money-bank-making-first-wwe-money-bank-match\">the first Money in the Bank</a> match and is a member of the WWE Hall of Fame. </p>\n<p>Copeland's incredible WWE career paused for what many, including Copeland, believed was for good in 2011. After sustaining injuries to his neck, he had triple-fusion surgery and it was believed he would never wrestle again. At the 2020 Royal Rumble, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/28969024/wrestlemania-36-return-wwe-edge-never-thought-was-possible\">he shocked the world with his return</a>. He has spent the past few years in storylines with Randy Orton, Roman Reigns and Judgment Day.</p>\n<p>His final match in WWE came on August 18 against Sheamus. After the match, he thanked the fans and said it would most likely be his last time in a WWE ring.</p>\n<p>Rumors swirled about his potential landing in AEW, and those rumors were confirmed on Sunday night.</p>\n<p>\"I felt free. That's just the word. It felt fun...,\" Copeland said about his appearance on Sunday. \"At this stage of my career, that's just special. Thirty-one years in and to feel that way, that's just a gift.\"</p>\n<p><inline2></p>\n\n\n\n\n",

        "story": "<p><photo1></p>\n<p>The last time a wrestling event was held at London's Wembley Stadium, The British Bulldog -- also known as Davey Boy Smith -- defeated Bret \"The Hitman\" Hart in the SummerSlam headliner for the Intercontinental championship.</p>\n<p>The match was a classic, a hotly anticipated bout that featured an intriguing lead-up. At the center of it was Smith's real-life wife, Diana, who is Hart's sister. The storyline featured Diana torn over who she wanted to come out on top in the battle for the IC title.</p>\n<p>Hart fondly recalls the 25-minute-plus main event as the favorite of his legendary career. Pro Wrestling Illustrated also named it Match of the Year for 1992.</p>\n<p>\"My dad would tell me later that it's one thing to have a great match,\" said Hart in his biography, \"Hitman.\" \"But it's another thing to have a great match in front of eighty thousand people.\"</p>\n<p><alsosee></p>\n<p>The announced attendance ended up being 80,497, which would be the largest in the British Bulldog's career, and it was in front of his passionate British fans.</p>\n<p>Thirty-one years later, wrestling returns to the famed outdoor football stadium with AEW's All In on Sunday, topped by MJF's world championship defense against tag team partner Adam Cole (1 p.m. ET). More than 80,000 fans are expected for the debut of Tony Khan's promotion in the United Kingdom.</p>\n<p>\"The U.K. is one of the most important markets in professional wrestling, and AEW is coming in hot as the No. 1 wrestling company in the U.K. on television,\" Khan said in April when All In London was announced. \"We want our debut in London to be epic in scale, and there's no better venue than Wembley Stadium to deliver what I know will be one of the greatest events in AEW's history.\"</p>\n<p>The co-feature will pit longtime rivals from Ring of Honor, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/3962508/cm-punk\">CM Punk</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/18590139/wwe-profile-page-samoa-joe\">Samoa Joe</a>, in a battle for what Punk calls the \"real world championship.\" The wrestling star was AEW champion when he tore his triceps. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/37860179/aew-star-cm-punk-new-show-injury-elephants-room\">Between the injury and reported backstage drama</a>, Punk was absent from AEW television for nine months before he returned this summer.</p>\n\n\n<p>During that time, MJF firmly established himself as the company's top star. He's held the championship for over 275 days after defeating Jon Moxley for the title at Full Gear last November. MJF was recognized as <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/38118887/from-mjf-rhea-ripley-toel-hijo-del-vikingo-professional-wrestling-30-30\">the top wrestler under 30 years old by ESPN last month</a>.</p>\n\n\n<p>In a rare move, MJF and Adam Cole will both pull double duty. They'll open -- and close -- All In with title matches. The All In Zero Hour preshow features the pair against Aussie Open (Mark Davis and Kyle Fletcher) for the Ring of Honor tag team championship.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"And if you think, just cause I'm your bud, I'm going to lay down on Aug. 27, you're out of your goddamned mind,\" MJF told Cole regarding their relationship on AEW Dynamite. \"I love ya like a brother, but a win at Wembley will make me legendary.\"</p>\n<p><inline2></p>\n<p>Performing at Wembley has become a milestone for many in the world of sport. The stadium has been revered by many as a world-class establishment for events. The stadium hosted some of the most iconic international sporting events, including the 1966 World Cup Final, UEFA's European Championships, the 1948 Summer Olympics, the 2015 Rugby World Cup, and of course, WWE's SummerSlam in 1992.</p>\n<p>Wembley has also played host to numerous heavyweight championship boxing matches. Anthony Joshua scored the biggest win of his career when he rose off the canvas to stop Wladimir Klitschko in ESPN's 2017 Fight of the Year before 90,000. Last year, Tyson Fury retained the lineal heavyweight crown with a TKO win over Dillian Whyte in front of an announced crowd of 94,000.</p>\n<p>On Sunday, more wrestling hardware will be on the line when FTR (Dax Hardwood and Cash Wheeler) defends the AEW tag-team championship against The Young Bucks (Matt and Nick Jackson).</p>\n<p><inline1></p>\n<p>A third tag-team match -- a coffin match -- pits 64-year-old Sting, one of the biggest stars in wrestling history, alongside Darby Allin in a coffin match against Swerve Strickland and Christian Cage, who replaced AR Fox.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"For sure, a lot of people have wondered if I will retire in Wembley, that would be very cool, but I don't see that happening,\" Sting told reporters in a media scrum following AEW's Forbidden Door in June. \"I think I'm going to continue on.\"</p>\n\n\n<p>Another highly anticipated match features Will Ospreay taking on the legendary Chris Jericho. Ospreay is coming off his instant classic against Kenny Omega at Forbidden Door.</p>\n<p>The AEW Women's World Championship will be up for grabs, too. Hikaru Shida, Toni Storm, Saraya and Dr. Britt Baker, D.M.D. will vie for the grandest women's prize in AEW in a fatal-four-way match.</p>\n<p><photo2></p>\n<p>The trios match could steal the show, though. The Golden Elite (Kota Ibushi, Kenny Omega and \"Hangman\" Adam Page) will battle Bullet Club Gold (Juice Robinson and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/4688808/jay-white\">Jay White</a>) alongside Konosuke Takeshita.</p>\n<p>And in a Stadium Stampede match, Eddie Kingston, Orange Cassidy, Best Friends (Chuck Taylor and Trent Beretta) and Penta El Zero Miedo will meet Blackpool Combat Club (Jon Moxley, Claudio Castagnoli and Wheeler Yuta) alongside Santana and Ortiz. House of Black will also face a potentially retiring Billy Gunn and the Acclaimed.</p>\n<p>The Khan family will be adding to their history in London. Tony's father, Shad Khan, is the Chairman of Fulham Football Club, which earned promotion to the English Premier League with wins at Wembley in 2018 and '20. Shad Khan also owns the NFL's Jacksonville Jaguars, who will play their ninth game at Wembley this season.</p>\n<p>And on Sunday, AEW will announce its U.K. arrival in the grandest way possible, etching another chapter -- and the promotion's name -- into the storied history of Wembley.</p>\n\n\n\n\n",

        "story": "<p><photo1></p>\n<p>The pro-wrestling business is on the upswing. WWE is selling out arenas at a torrid pace and posting impressive television ratings. AEW is about to put a potentially record-setting amount of people inside London's Wembley Stadium later this month. Impact is as good as it has been in years.</p>\n<p>Overseas, stalwarts New Japan Pro-Wrestling and CMLL in Mexico have recovered from rough pandemic stretches. Stardom is the fastest growing promotion in the world. Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide, commonly referred to as just AAA, just drew more than 15,000 people for its TripleMania Tijuana show last month.</p>\n<p>At ESPN, we have made lists of the best 25 fighters under the age of 25 in both MMA and boxing. So, why not a similar list for pro wrestling? In the fight game, athletes usually peak younger. But in wrestling, it's typically somewhere in an athlete's 30s. \"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin was 33 when his popularity exploded in 1998, Hulk Hogan was 31 at WrestleMania 1 and Roman Reigns is doing his best work right now at age 38.</p>\n<p>Below is our list of the 30 best pro wrestlers under the age of 30. The rankings were based on merit rather than on future potential, which is far more subjective. The criteria included drawing power; popularity; skills; position on the roster; and accomplishments, including championships and tournament victories. About a dozen different promotions are represented in some way over multiple countries.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n<h2>1. MJF</h2>\n\n\n<p><photo or=\"\" video-tk=\"\"> </photo></p>\n\n\n<p><photo2></p>\n<p>Promotion: AEW<br>\nAge: 27</p>\n<p>\"Generational talent\" isn't just a nickname or catchphrase. Long Island's own Maxwell Jacob Friedman is one of the best mid-20s wrestlers the business has seen in some time. He's already the focal point of AEW, winning the promotion's world championship last November. ESPN rated him the 2022 promo artist of the year and, frankly, he's been just as good in between the ropes. MJF's Ironman match with Bryan Danielson at AEW Revolution in March was an instant classic, and his four-way match with Jack Perry, Darby Allin and Sammy Guevara was excellent, too. It's scary to think he hasn't reached his prime yet.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>2. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/31223052/wwe-profile-rhea-ripley\">Rhea Ripley</a></h2>\n<p><video1></p>\n\n\n<p>Promotion: WWE<br>\nAge: 26</p>\n<p>At her young age, Ripley already has a Hall of Fame résumé inside the ring, whether by her emergence on the indie scene, NXT UK, NXT or the WWE main roster. Everywhere Ripley has gone, she's held a title, and is the only wrestler, man or woman, to say they've won gold in NXT UK, NXT and WWE. As one-fourth of Judgment Day, Ripley's presence and demeanor haven't only elevated the faction -- it's given added gravity to Dominik Mysterio. It's a matter of when, not if \"Mami\" will be considered among the greatest performers to ever step inside the squared circle.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>3. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/29202013/wwe-profile-page-austin-theory\">Austin Theory</a></h2>\n\n\n<p><alsosee></p>\n<p>Promotion: WWE<br>\nAge: 26</p>\n<p>It would not be a shock to see him as the face of the entire industry in a few years. Theory, the WWE United States champion, has some things to polish up. He just turned 26 years old, after all.</p>\n<p>But he's a five-tool player, good at just about everything you want a wrestler to be good at. He has the looks, the charisma, the athleticism and the presence to be a top guy for a long time. Just wait until he puts it all together.</p>\n<hr>\n\n\n<h2>4. El Hijo del Vikingo</h2>\n\n\n<p>Promotion: AAA/AEW/ROH/GCW<br>\nAge: 26</p>\n<p>A second-generation star, Vikingo has already carved out a name as lucha libre's next heir apparent in AAA. However, his March 22 match against Kenny Omega on AEW Dynamite promptly set social media ablaze. With fluidity and zero abandon, Vikingo attempted to break gravity on several occasions, via springboard 630 splashes, Phoenix splashes and more. At his young age, he is already the third-longest reigning AAA Mega Champion. More and more U.S. audiences will become aware of Vikingo's greatness, making him a near-impossible act to miss.</p>\n<hr>\n\n\n<h2>5. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/29768294/wwe-profile-page-dominik-mysterio\">Dominik Mysterio</a></h2>\n<p><photo3></p>\n\n\n<p>Promotion: WWE<br>\nAge: 26</p>\n<p>The son of the greatest luchador of all time, Rey Mysterio, found a way to escape his father's shadow in 2022 with a long-awaited heel turn at Clash At The Castle. No matter the arena, Dominik is a heat magnet, a character so easy to hate that you forget to notice his in-ring work is only improving. From a high-profile showcase match against his father at WrestleMania this year to winning the NXT North American title, Dom's evolution is only moving upward.</p>\n<hr>\n\n\n<h2>6. Bron Breakker</h2>\n\n\n<p><photo4></p>\n<p>Promotion: WWE NXT</p>\n<p>Age: 25</p>\n<p>Comparisons don't always translate across generations in pro wrestling. But Breakker combines his father, Rick Steiner, and uncle, Scott Steiner, mixed with a splash of Goldberg. The 6-foot, 230-pound former college football player has already been a two-time NXT champion, with his last reign lasting nearly a year (362 days). Breakker is an excellent athlete who looks like a badass and should be unleashed on the main roster before long. It doesn't take understanding Steiner math to realize his potential.</p>\n<hr>\n\n\n<h2>7. Carmelo Hayes</h2>\n\n\n<p>Promotion: WWE NXT<br>\nAge: 28</p>\n<p>\"Melo Don't Miss\" isn't only a mantra for the current NXT champion -- it's become symbolic of everything he does in the ring. Hayes rocketed through the NXT ranks, shifting from Breakout tournament winner to the longest combined reign as NXT North American champ, to now the No. 1 guy on Tuesday nights. From his in-ring ability to the work on the mic and elaborate entrances paying homage to putting names in the rafters, it won't be long before Melo is prominently on SmackDown or Raw.</p>\n<hr>\n\n\n<h2>8. Konosuke Takeshita</h2>\n\n\n<p>Promotion: AEW/DDT<br>\nAge: 28</p>\n<p>In Japan, Konosuke Takeshita had already emerged as a young gem, honing his skills as a young prodigy in DDT Pro-Wrestling. When he arrived stateside in AEW, Takeshita, who once vowed to compete in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, quickly earned the fans' respect and adoration with matches against Adam Page, Jon Moxley and Kenny Omega. Having already proven himself inside an AEW ring and emerging as one of the company's budding heels, Takeshita's on the path to making even more noise stateside.</p>\n<hr>\n\n\n<h2>9. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/21658533/wwe-profile-page-liv-morgan\">Liv Morgan</a></h2>\n<p><photo5></p>\n\n\n<p>Promotion: WWE<br>\nAge: 29</p>\n<p>Morgan signed to NXT when she was 20. Nine years later, the former two-time women's tag team champion, Money in the Bank winner and SmackDown women's champ is barely scratching the surface, whether it be her performance in-ring or character work. From challenging Becky Lynch during the peak of \"Big Time Becks\" to taking down <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/2563796/ronda-rousey\">Ronda Rousey</a>, Morgan has long shed the label of being a plucky underdog waiting for her moment. Now she's poised to be remembered as one of the more underrated stars of the women's division.</p>\n<hr>\n\n\n<h2>10. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/34935710/wwe-profile-page-logan-paul\">Logan Paul</a></h2>\n<p><video2></p>\n\n\n<p>Promotion: WWE<br>\nAge: 28</p>\n<p>This might be somewhat of a polarizing pick, but Paul -- like his brother, Jake -- is a polarizing guy. The YouTuber-turned-combat-sports-disruptor is only a part-time wrestler for WWE, though it's impossible to overlook the impact he has had and how good his performances have been. Paul has only been in big matches -- including a bout for the Undisputed WWE Universal title against Roman Reigns -- and has pulled off some incredible feats. For someone who has had only six matches in his career, Paul's ability has been preternatural.</p>\n<hr>\n\n\n\n<h2>11. Giulia</h2>\n\n\n<p>Promotion: Stardom<br>\nAge: 29</p>\n<p>Born in London to an Italian father and a Japanese mother, Giulia would be a superstar in any part of the world. Her fashion and swagger are unmatched in the business, and she's constantly changing her look while somehow never missing. Giulia, a former World of Stardom and Wonder of Stardom champion, currently holds the New Japan Strong women's title. While her clothes appear to be straight out of a model's closet, Giulia's work in the ring is ruthless and violent. U.S. fans will get a treat when she makes her debut here later this month.</p>\n<hr>\n\n\n\n<h2>12. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/37892548/wwe-profile-page-butch\">Butch</a></h2>\n\n\n<p>Promotion: WWE<br>\nAge: 29</p>\n<p>Whether he's Butch or Pete Dunne, one thing is for sure when the Brit is in the ring: fingers are going to get snapped. Since 2017, Butch has made waves in all three separate WWE brands, including a record reign as NXT UK champion and memorable matches with Tyler Bate and Gunther. Within the Brawling Brutes, he's their fulcrum, an aggressive medium between Sheamus and Ridge Holland that keeps all parties level. In-ring wise, it's only a matter of time before the former bruiserweight emerges as a potential top guy.</p>\n<hr>\n\n\n\n<h2>13. Jack Perry</h2>\n\n\n<p><photo6></p>\n<p>Promotion: AEW<br>\nAge: 26</p>\n<p>Jungle Boy is no more. The babyface character Perry portrayed to start his career is gone now, giving way to an arrogant heel befitting his upbringing as a Hollywood kid. The son of the late, great actor Luke Perry, Jack is a former AEW tag team champion (with Luchasaurus) and challenged for the AEW world title in a four-way match at Double or Nothing in May. Last month, he beat Hook to win the FTW title, his first major victory in this promising run as a villain.</p>\n<hr>\n\n\n\n<h2>14. Wes Lee</h2>\n\n\n<p><photo7></p>\n<p>Promotion: WWE NXT<br>\nAge: 28</p>\n<p>A former NXT tag team champion, Wes Lee not only managed to add to the legacy of NXT's North American title but also became its greatest champion during a historic reign. Known for his grace in the sky and ability to have a great match with virtually anyone, Lee embodies what it means to \"have next\" in wrestling. Before long, he'll be transitioning away from the black and gold brand and onto Raw or SmackDown, giving network TV another highwire act to fall in love with.</p>\n<hr>\n\n\n\n<h2>15. Utami Hayashishita</h2>\n\n\n<p>Promotion: Stardom<br>\nAge: 24</p>\n<p>Hayashishita came into Stardom with some celebrity. She's the daughter of Japanese TV personality Kiyoshi \"Big Daddy\" Hayashishita and got a huge push immediately as the \"Big Rookie.\" But Utami, a black belt in judo, has wholly shed the criticisms that it was too much, too soon. The former World of Stardom champion became one of the world's best women's wrestlers, and her series of matches with Syuri was the best women's wrestling has to offer in this era.</p>\n<hr>\n\n\n\n<h2>16. Toni Storm</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Promotion: AEW<br>\nAge: 27</p>\n<p>The New Zealand-born wrestler spent much of her upbringing in Australia and is no stranger to travel. But she's been a star everywhere she's been. Storm is a former World of Stardom and NXT UK champion and is currently in her second reign as the AEW women's champ. She has even held titles in England and Germany. The accomplishments for Storm are fitting of some wrestler's 20-year career, and yet it still feels like she's just scratching the surface of her potential.</p>\n<hr>\n\n\n\n<h2>17. Dragon Lee</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><photo8></p>\n<p>Promotion: WWE NXT<br>\nAge: 28</p>\n<p>A second-generation lucha libre star in his native Mexico, Dragon Lee is one of only a few wrestlers to have performed in AEW and then transitioned to WWE since the former promotion launched in 2019. Once he stepped foot in a WWE ring, Lee was already stamped to in-the-know fans as a former IWGP junior heavyweight champion, former two-time Ring of Honor Television and ROH tag team champ and two-time CMLL World Lightweight champion. It won't be long before he begins adding titles in NXT to his growing resume.</p>\n<hr>\n\n\n\n<h2>18. Bandido</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><photo9></p>\n<p>Promotion: AEW/GCW<br>\nAge: 28</p>\n<p>\"The Most Wanted\" is one of the best masked luchadors in the world. Bandido mixes the traditional high flying of Mexican wrestling with incredible strength, making him a well-rounded talent. The well-traveled Bandido has been the Ring of Honor and Pro Wrestling Guerrilla world champion, runs his own promotion in Mexico called Big Lucha and is a sometimes talent for Game Changer Wrestling in the U.S. and GLEAT in Japan. That schedule won't let up now that he's signed with AEW.</p>\n<hr>\n\n\n\n<h2>19. Jamie Hayter</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><photo10></p>\n<p>Promotion: AEW<br>\nAge: 28</p>\n<p>Owning the third-longest reign as AEW Women's world champion is no small feat considering she had been cutting her teeth all across the United Kingdom and Japan before arriving stateside for good in 2021. Similarly to the likes of Rhea Ripley, Hayter's imposing presence in the ring makes every move feel sudden and direct, a bold contrast to some of her fellow competitors in the division. Soon, Hayter may reign again as queen of AEW, but she's already carved out a place among wrestling's best young talents.</p>\n<hr>\n\n\n\n<h2>20. Wheeler Yuta</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><photo11></p>\n<p>Promotion: AEW<br>\nAge: 26</p>\n<p>To go from Philly underdog to learning under Bryan Danielson is a fantastic transition for Wheeler Yuta. A former two-time ROH Pure champion, the Blackpool Combat Club member can say he got a pin on Kenny Omega in an Anarchy in the Arena match and had one of the more visceral moments on TV when he fell in Blood and Guts, AEW's version of War Games. Yuta's technical skill continues to develop in the ring, and at only 26, he's surrounded by proven vets such as Jon Moxley, Claudio Castagnoli and Danielson. Yuta should have no choice but to become one of the best technical wrestlers on the planet.</p>\n<hr>\n\n\n\n<h2>21. Kaito Kiyomiya</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Promotion: Pro Wrestling NOAH<br>\nAge: 27</p>\n<p>The future (and perhaps current) ace of NOAH has had an interesting year. Early in 2023, he became embroiled in a blood feud with New Japan ace Kazuchika Okada, extending into a spot in New Japan's prestigious G1 Climax tournament. The idea for NOAH is to get more eyes on its golden-haired, baby-faced prodigy before bringing him back as a dominant top guy. Kiyomiya is already a former two-time holder of the GHC Heavyweight belt, NOAH's top title.</p>\n<hr>\n\n\n\n<h2>22. Saya Kamitani</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Promotion: Stardom<br>\nAge: 26</p>\n<p>Flashy and athletic with a background in dance, Kamitani is one of the best high-flyers in women's wrestling. She can pull off a somersaulting Phoenix Splash and springboard moves off the ropes, into and out of the ring. But she became much more than someone who can produce entertaining moments over the last year, holding the Wonder of Stardom title for 480 days with a host of excellent performances in those record-setting 15 defenses.</p>\n<hr>\n\n\n\n<h2>23. Yota Tsuji</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Promotion: New Japan<br>\nAge: 29</p>\n<p>The next potential general in the Los Ingobernables de Japon (LIJ) stable, Tsuji graduated from \"young lion\" in his first stint in New Japan Pro Wrestling to a talked-about commodity. Upon his June return, the 6-foot Tsuji had star written all over him thanks to his look, sudden strikes in the ring and demand to challenge for the IWGP World Heavyweight title. With more high-profile matches already on his plate in the G1 Climax, he's already on the path of ascension in NJPW, perhaps taking LIJ into a new evolution as well.</p>\n<hr>\n\n\n\n<h2>24. Jordynne Grace</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Promotion: Independent<br>\nAge: 27</p>\n<p>There are powerlifters in the world of pro wrestling and then there's Grace, a 5-foot-3, well-muscled dynamo who became one of the faces of Impact Wrestling's Knockouts division. A former two-time Knockouts champion, a former Knockouts tag team champion and the winner of the company's Knockout of the Year award in 2022, Grace set a new standard for others to follow behind her in Impact. Currently a free agent, there's no telling when and where she'll continue building her name.</p>\n<hr>\n\n\n\n<h2>25. Deonna Purrazzo</h2>\n\n\n<p><photo12></p>\n\n\n<p>Promotion: Impact<br>\nAge: 29</p>\n<p>Impact Wrestling (and TNA before it) have had a pioneering women's division long before highlighting female talent was en vogue. Purrazzo has followed in the footsteps of predecessors like Gail Kim and becomes the clear ace of Impact Knockouts. Purrazzo has had three reigns with the Knockouts title since the beginning of 2020, for a total of 531 days with the championship. She's also held belts in Ring of Honor and AAA.</p>\n<hr>\n\n\n\n<h2>26. Ilja Dragunov</h2>\n\n\n<p><photo13></p>\n\n\n<p>Promotion: WWE NXT<br>\nAge: 29</p>\n<p>The stiffest matches in NXT history, NXT UK or otherwise, have involved Dragunov in his attempts to dethrone Gunther as NXT UK champion. Every time Dragunov steps into the ring, you expect passion and violence in ways not commonly seen on American television. \"The Mad Dragon\" proclaims to be NXT's toughest star, and there's very little debate on the subject. Perhaps it's his time for him to claim the throne of NXT, much like he did in the UK.</p>\n<hr>\n\n\n\n<h2>27. Masha Slamovich</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Promotion: Impact/GCW<br>\nAge: 25</p>\n<p>Born in Russia with training in Japan, Slamovich is well-rounded and simply one of the most promising young women's wrestlers in the world. She won the Impact Knockouts tag team titles with Killer Kelly last month and is sure to be a factor long-term in that division. Slamovich has arguably done her best work in Game Changer Wrestling, where she had a stint as the promotion's world champion -- not women's champ -- earlier this year after beating deathmatch legend Nick Gage.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<h2>28. Tyler Bate</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><photo14></p>\n<p>Promotion: WWE NXT<br>\nAge: 26</p>\n<p>The \"Big Strong Boi\" became an NXT mainstay across the pond and otherwise with his work in the Cruiserweight Classic and then having a match of the year with Butch in 2017 for the UK Championship. In a land of super athletes, Bate counts himself among them despite his 5-foot-7 height. After already making history as the youngest performer to ever win singles gold in WWE at age 19, Bate continues to make waves within NXT, capable of putting on a match-of-the-night contender with anyone.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<h2>29. Daniel Garcia</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Promotion: AEW/PWG<br>\nAge: 24</p>\n<p>It's not only dance moves with the Buffalo standout, as the 24-year-old Garcia has proven on several occasions within AEW and elsewhere he's one of the more prodigious technical wrestlers in the world. After winning the ROH Pure title in 2022, Garcia celebrated as if the Bills had won the Super Bowl and immediately launched into a feud with Bryan Danielson. Garcia continually finds himself across the ring from legendary technical savants, and before long, future stars can say they stepped in the ring with him.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<h2>30. Shota Umino</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Promotion: New Japan<br>\nAge: 26</p>\n<p>Umino has a strong chance to be in the top 10, if not the top 5, of this list next year. He, Tsuji and Ren Narita were named the Reiwa Three Musketeers, following in the footsteps of the last generation's trio: Hiroshi Tanahashi, Shinsuke Nakamura and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/2354277/katsuyori-shibata\">Katsuyori Shibata</a>. Those are some large shoes to fill. But Umino, a unique amalgamation of Jon Moxley and Tanahashi, has all the abilities to become a future multiple-time Tokyo Dome headliner.</p>\n\n\n<p><b>Honorable mention:</b> <em>Atlantis Jr., AZM, Blake Christian, Cameron Grimes, Creed Brothers, Kris Statlander, Lio Rush, Maki Itoh, Miyu Yamashita, Ren Narita, Riho, Roxanne Perez, Starlight Kid, Shun Skywalker, Sonya Deville, Kyle Fletcher of Aussie Open</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n",

        "story": "<p><video1></p>\n<p>Damian Priest is just eight weeks removed from one of WWE's most chaotic matches of the year, a San Juan Street Fight against wildly popular recording artist Bad Bunny. That match, at WWE Backlash on May 6, contained a shopping cart full of weapons, a terrifying suplex off an audio rig through a table and the use of a heavy, metal chain.</p>\n<p>The worst part, though? Getting hit over and over again by Bad Bunny with a kendo stick, Priest said.</p>\n<p>\"That's one of the worst things that we introduced into this business,\" Priest told ESPN. \"I wish that somebody would've never brought those into this business, because man, those are killer, dude. It's not just the day or when it happens, they leave these welts and anything you touch burns and they're brutal.\"</p>\n<p>Priest landed a kendo stick shot on Bad Bunny, as well. The weapon, a bamboo or wooden staff used in training for the martial art of kendo in lieu of a sword, has been used as a \"foreign object\" in pro wrestling for decades.</p>\n<p>\"I hit him one time with the kendo stick and he said he couldn't feel his arm for a second,\" Priest said.</p>\n<p>There are no breaks for Priest. He'll perform in his first Money in the Bank ladder match Saturday, the signature match of the WWE live event in London. Priest and six other men have a chance to earn a title shot at any time by climbing the ladder and grabbing a briefcase with a contract in it.</p>\n<p><photo5></p>\n<p>The ladder match, one of the most dangerous in pro wrestling, is star-studded this weekend. YouTuber-turned-wrestling-phenom Logan Paul will be in it, along with Shinsuke Nakamura, LA Knight, Ricochet, Santos Escobar and Butch.</p>\n<p>Priest is no stranger to working with celebrities like Paul, especially after that match with Bad Bunny two months ago in Puerto Rico.</p>\n<p>\"I know he was really banged up,\" Priest said of the reggaeton superstar. \"Apparently, it took him a few days to really get moving again, move around normal, which is to be fair. I understand because the soreness, it's like being in a train wreck or a big, bad car wreck. Your whole body is sore. And it took him days to recover, and we don't know when we'll see him again after that one, because he apparently went through it really bad. Now, that's what we go through all the time. The difference is we don't get to take another year off. We got to go right back the following day or the following week.\"</p>\n\n\n<p>The bodies of pro wrestling stars have gone through a ton of abuse over the years, with immediate and then cumulative effects. Some wrestlers are not so lucky and the wrong spill or landing can be a career- or life-changing one.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"There's nobody's body that's built for this,\" Priest said. \"This is what we do and it's insane just because ... there's no offseason and we just keep going and going. And mainly because for the love of the business.\"</p>\n<p>ESPN asked some of the top names in WWE, including Priest, about the worst bumps -- the wrestling term for falls -- they've taken and what those felt like.</p>\n<hr>\n\n\n\n<h3>Braun Strowman, former WWE Universal champion</h3>\n\n\n<p><alsosee></p>\n<p>Let's be real. The human body is not designed to get picked up and slammed on the ground. None of them feel good.</p>\n<p>One of the worst bumps I ever took was when I got triple powerbombed by Bobby Lashley, Drew McIntyre and Baron Corbin in 2019. They were standing on top of the steel steps, and they powerbombed me through two tables. For some odd reason, that bump was just awful. I think it was just because there was so much weight in the ring that it was already collapsed or compressed, so there was no give in it. And then them putting me just through the tables, I remember hitting the mat, and it felt like I hit concrete. It just stopped and knocked the breath out of me and everything.</p>\n<p>I was rolling around like a fish gasping for water.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<h3>Seth Rollins, WWE world heavyweight champion</h3>\n<p><video2></p>\n\n\n<p>I've fallen off the [20-foot-high] Hell in a Cell structure twice. First, I was young and full of piss and vinegar. Felt great, as young people do. The second one wasn't even my match, mind you. It was Roman Reigns versus Braun Strowman [in 2018]. Brock Lesnar had come out and ripped the door off, ruining the whole match. And myself and Dean Ambrose (now Jon Moxley) had come out. Dolph Ziggler and Drew McIntyre had come out, and somehow Dolph and I had been tasked with taking a big bump to save this rotten finish that the company had booked. Why I agreed to it? I'll never know. But my lower back is still jacked up from that. And we're talking like [five] years ago. So that's the one.</p>\n<p>I landed on the announce table. And we added a little pad on there? No, no. We're tough. We got this. But we had wrestled a banger tag match at the beginning of the night. Then we came out at the end. So, I had been sitting for three hours. My body had fully tightened up. I tried to loosen up as best I could, but there's no substitute. So, we went up there cold, came down cold. And I remember laying there just thinking, \"This is it. I'm never going to walk again.\" It was bad. I thought that was the end for me. Like maybe I'll never wrestle again. Maybe that's it. Maybe we hang it up tonight.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Cody Rhodes, 2023 WWE men's Royal Rumble winner</h3>\n\n\n<p>I skin the cat, which is when you go over the top rope and you hang on. And one time when I did it, the mat wasn't covering the boards underneath. So, there was a board jutting out. I just didn't check the ring earlier in the day, which is why you should always check the ring. But the board hit me in the back.</p>\n<p>So, as I'm dangling there, trying to look cool before I flip back into the ring, I thought I had blown my C4 vertebra or something. This was [2012]. I mean, I was able to finish the match and stuff, but it scratched me up a lot. And it also scared me from skinning the cat. So, if you see me do one, it's random. The match was against Justin Gabriel. Oddly, it was not his fault nor mine. We just had no rhythm. Things like that were happening.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Damian Priest, former WWE United States champion</h3>\n<p><photo1></p>\n\n\n<p>It was In Your House 2020 in NXT. I thought it was a good idea to try to slam Finn Balor on top of some steps off the apron. He ended up knocking me off the apron and I flew down to the floor where the steps were. And I'll be honest, when I hit those steps, I thought I broke everything inside me. Like, everything.</p>\n<p>The ref was counting and I was like, \"I think I'm just going to get counted out.\" I did not want to move. And then around when the referee was at 7, I was like, \"Oh, I think I can move.\" It was the middle to lower back that hit. So, when I fell back, I almost missed the steps, so it hit my middle and lower back, and then I landed on my head on the rest of the floor. So yeah, it was a good one.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Sami Zayn, former three-time WWE Intercontinental champion</h3>\n\n\n<p>I'm not sure if this is the worst, but the first one that comes to mind is a tag match I had with Kevin Owens against Nigel McGuinness and Go Shiozaki in Ring of Honor in 2008. I did like a flip dive while Kevin had Nigel in the sharpshooter. I was going to take out Go Shiozaki with a dive. I went to the top rope, and as I stood on the top rope, I go, \"Wow, he's so big and strong. I'm going to really go for it this time.\" And I jumped as high as I could and flipped in midair. He did not catch me at all.</p>\n<p>I just landed and felt all my organs go like, \"Blerghh!\" It's like the outer part of my body kept my organs from exploding. But that's all it did. It kept them in my body. But they all wanted to explode. There was a very thin mat, but it didn't do much.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Kevin Owens, former WWE Universal Champion</h3>\n<p><photo2></p>\n\n\n<p>The chokeslam from Braun Strowman onto the steel ramp at SummerSlam 2018. I felt a ringing in my body for about four months after. I don't know if anything was structurally wrong, but not long after, I took six months off. I don't know if that was related, but it didn't help. I felt that for a long time.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Rhea Ripley, WWE Women's World Champion</h3>\n<p><photo3></p>\n\n\n<p>I've taken a lot of bad ones. There's been a lot of crappy bumps in my life. But one of the worst was my Last Woman Standing match (which requires a wrestler to keep an opponent down for a 10-count, rather than the traditional three) with Raquel Rodriguez in NXT in 2021.</p>\n<p>She gave me a back body drop onto the announcers' table, but I didn't make it to the table completely. I hit the edge, and then the table broke, but it legitimately screwed my back up and my lower back has never been the same. A lot of pain. It was just an awkward bump. And then to continue after that with the Last Woman Standing match, going through the stage, falling down the steps, and going through the glass, it was just a compilation of everything. Sometimes you get a weird spot and you can't control it. It's so random sometimes. Even the ref came to me, he's like, \"Are you OK?\" I was like, \"That sucked.\"</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Finn Balor, former WWE Universal champion</h3>\n<p><photo4></p>\n\n\n<p>I was training in a gym in my home country of Ireland and tried this move that one of my friends called a backpack stunner, where you pick someone up like a piggyback and give him a stunner. They land on their butt. But whatever way it was, I was actually taller than the guy and I landed butt first with all of his weight and my weight. I cracked my tailbone. That's one that sticks out. That was an absolute killer. I was like 20 or 22 years old.</p>\n<p>There's been another couple where I'll do the flip dive over the top rope. I'll miss the guy, or the guy will move out of the way. And those always hurt, too. They'll knock the wind out of you. But the one, that injury to the tailbone lasted three or four months. It was terrible. I was just walking around in pain, trying to wrestle the best I could.</p>\n<p>But I could go on for days. There was one, I got in a small package [pinning position] and whatever way he pulled me was so tight that when I twisted, my ribs popped. A small package, like the silliest move in the world. That was in New Japan Pro-Wrestling in 2010, a tag team tournament and the first of four matches over that weekend. It was against Davey Richards. He and Rocky Romero against Ryusuke Taguchi and me.</p>\n<hr>\n\n\n<h3>Bayley, former Raw and SmackDown women's champion</h3>\n\n\n<p>One of the worst ones I took was in Saudi Arabia last year when I had my Last Woman Standing match with Bianca Belair for the Raw women's title. And it was just a suplex onto the ramp, the ramp that you walked down at the entrance. And that was one of the worst feelings I've ever had in wrestling. It just knocked the wind out of me. I don't know what kind of ramp that was. I don't know if I wasn't ready for it or what, but it knocked the wind out of me. That was bad. I was not expecting that.</p>\n<p>My lower back felt like it just crumbled, from my tailbone and halfway up my back. It was one of those where you could feel it in your thighs. It shifted down to my thighs. It felt like it shattered and I was thrown into a cement wall. It kind of lingered a little bit. I was limping slightly after that, but even Bianca said the same thing. I think she took a belly-to-belly suplex on the ramp and she's like, \"I don't know what that was.\" She was like, \"I saw my soul leave my body.\"</p>\n\n\n\n\n",

        "story": "<p>Tony Khan doesn't have the most regular sleep cycle. Serving as the president, chief executive, general manager and executive producer of All Elite Wrestling (AEW), alongside roles with father Shad Khan's NFL franchise the Jacksonville Jaguars and Premier League side Fulham FC, will do that to a person. \"I get sleep in spurts,\" he laughs to ESPN Australia and New Zealand. \"I try to get in the good ones when I can, especially on a weekend, if I can get in an eight-hour night that's great. But now with Collision, those will be a little different too and I think that's awesome.\"</p>\n<p>The Collision that Khan is referring to, in this case, isn't some kind of catastrophic impact between a Jaguars linebacker and an opposition quarterback but, instead, AEW's newest show, AEW Collision, which recently made its debut in the United States with a card featuring the likes of Australian wrestler Buddy Mathews and controversial returning star CM Punk - <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/37860179/aew-star-cm-punk-new-show-injury-elephants-room\">who spoke to <em>ESPN </em>ahead of the debut episode</a>.</p>\n<p>\"I think he's a huge part of the show,\" Khan told <em>ESPN</em>, speaking before the publication of Punk's interview. \"We're absolutely really excited to feature CM Punk in Collision. I think it's one of the things that we're excited to see. I know fans all over the world are excited to see CM Punk's return to wrestling and I'm excited for CM Punk to return.\"</p>\n<p>Punk's return, he teamed with AEW World Tag Team Champions FTR -- Dax Harwood and Cash Wheeler -- to get the win over Jay White, Juice Robinson, and his longtime nemesis Samoa Joe in the main event, highlighted Collision's debut, with the foray into the largely untreated and risky world of Saturday night wrestling the latest touchstone on a period of significant period growth that the upstart promotion has undergone in recent times, a lot of which has been highlighted by the evolution of its international footprint. </p>\n<p><photo1></p>\n<p>Starting with the latest episode of Collision, AEW will stage its longest-ever string of shows outside the United States when it goes on an eight-show-long tour of Canada, a run which will include its special 'Forbidden Door' event produced in partnership with New Japan Pro Wrestling. On June 29, it will launch its first video game, 'Fight Forever' and thanks to deals such as the one that sees AEW Dynamite and AEW Rampage <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/wrestling/story/_/id/35660529/a-beginner-guide-all-elite-wrestling-in-expect-champions\">shown on ESPN across Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific</a>, Khan says that the promotion has a presence in 150 markets around the world. </p>\n<p>And perhaps most notable, AEW's first-ever show in the United Kingdom will not be some kind of low-key touring event or small, prerecorded television taping, but what Khan calls the biggest event in the promotion's short history: its flagship annual show <em>All In </em>being staged at Wembley Stadium, with nearly 70,000 tickets sold for the event.</p>\n<p>\"I'm very excited about what we've been able to do with AEW,\" said Khan. \"We've had great success building a worldwide challenger brand in pro wrestling.</p>\n<p>\"With AEW on in 150 countries now, it's amazing how far we've come. We're approaching 200 episodes of AEW Dynamite, which is miraculous and very cool. We've built something special on Wednesday nights and it's grown all over the world, to see how many countries have picked up the show and how much penetration we've had. </p>\n<p>\"Now, we have our biggest international event ever and the biggest event in the history of the company in AEW All In and a great chance to expand into other markets and new partnerships.\"</p>\n<p>Indeed, given the momentum that AEW has created for itself in what is a relatively short time -- main rival and the industry's largest promotion the WWE, in contrast, tracing a lineage all the way back to 1953 -- it's likely that the promotion could in all likelihood announce a one-off show in almost two-dozen markets around the world and sell out. But given the 52-week contractual demands of now providing three different shows for television such an ad hoc approach to international growth isn't feasible. </p>\n<p><photo2></p>\n<p>Khan on a number of occasions observes that there is no offseason in wrestling, meaning that every single week requires AEW to not only the production of a new episode of Dyanamite, Rampage, and now Collision, but also the booking of them with coherent, ongoing storylines and strong enough matches </p>\n<p>It's why the promotion has yet to determine where its next major avenue of international expansion will come. Places such as Germany and Japan are obvious possibilities, while Khan also said that Australia would be \"high on the list\". Right now though, for a still very young company, something like a string of shows in Canada, despite its proximity to the United States, is still its own challenge. </p>\n<p>\"This Canadian tour is our next international focus and it'll be the first time that we've toured and done this many consecutive shows outside the United States and, certainly, that is going to be a big challenge logistically for our crew,\" Khan explained. </p>\n<p>\"It involves everyone having passports, a lot of equipment crossing the border, and a number of permitting and logistical challenges that go into putting the show on every week. Even just crossing the border into Canada, which is relatively simple compared to leaving the continent, that's a lot of challenges for the production team.</p>\n<p>\"And then, from a travel standpoint, in terms of having that many people travelling from the team, week-to-week, it's a logistic challenge as it is getting people all over the United States into one city every Wednesday and now every Saturday and putting on a TV show.\"</p>\n<p>Another complicating factor for AEW is its partnerships with other promotions, as well as the ongoing presence of its wrestlers on the independent wrestling scene in addition to their work in AEW. New Japan Pro Wrestling, for instance, is well established in its homeland and stages its own tours of the United States, Europe, and even Australia, while Mexican partner organisation AAA is one of the oldest and most proud promotions in the traditional hotbed of professional wrestling. AEW contracted performers, meanwhile, are still able to appear on the shows of smaller, independent promotions in addition to their work in AEW, within limits.</p>\n<p><photo3></p>\n<p>\"Absolutely we expect that AEW comes first when people are taking outside bookings but we have great partnerships,\" said Khan. \"A lot of our wrestlers wrestle for top international organisations too. We have luchadors that compete in Mexico, compete in AAA. New Japan Pro Wrestling we work with very closely, and they have a relationship with CMLL, so there are a lot of international wrestling companies tied together - and then some that don't work together and we have to be cognizant of that!</p>\n<p>\"Then, we have other wrestling companies, independent promotions, that do sometimes feature AEW wrestlers but certainly we expect that they're going to put AEW first and not necessarily do we want to... I guess the best way to put it is that I support independent wrestling. We prioritise AEW, [but] I really do like independent wrestling and want to support it as much as we can without it being detrimental to our show.\"</p>\n<p>A fan of wrestling long before the birth of his own promotion, Khan serves as the lead booker for all of AEW's shows; serving as the invisible hand guiding the feuds, drama, and championship chases that provide the lifeblood of the eclectic mix of different performance types that make up professional wrestling. Regardless of scale or the historical period of the promotion in question, it's inevitably the storylines and characters that work to advance overarching narratives in both matches and spoken segments (promos, in wrestling jargon) that serve to give it all some kind of greater meaning and get audiences wanting to come back next week and see what happens. </p>\n<p>\"We have some of the best wrestlers; I think we have the best roster,\" said Khan. \"And a lot of them are also great talkers. They do a great job telling a story, and they do a great job explaining how they feel about a match or their opponent or their teammate or somebody that they might not want to associate with, might want to associate with. Nobody is better at explaining it than the top pro wrestlers. </p>\n<p>\"That's something that AEW brings, really strongly each week is some great interviews. You hear from top wrestlers in top spots and I want the wrestling fans to feel like they're getting to see the top wrestlers every week in top stories.</p>\n<p>\"I have a great memory for wrestling [continuity], to be honest. And I think a lot of wrestling fans do. I don't think there's anybody that has such keen memories. Not just for rivalries and matches and moves but also for the business side of it. It's amazing the kind of things that wrestling fans remember, all over the world. There's a connection in the business spirit, the entrepreneurial spirit of this.\"</p>\n\n\n\n\n",

        "story": "<p><photo1></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/3962508/cm-punk\">CM Punk</a> stepped down from a dais inside the bowels of NOW Arena in Hoffman Estates, Illinois, last Sept. 4 with blood still on his face, a towel around his neck, and bags of muffins and sparkling water in either hand. The All Elite Wrestling (AEW) World Championship belt he had just regained in the All Out pay-per-view main event against Jon Moxley was tucked under his right arm, the strap slung over his shoulder.</p>\n<p>Punk, one of the most popular and polarizing professional wrestlers of the past two decades, walked out of the news conference room in his native Chicagoland and, as far as AEW television is concerned, has hardly been seen since -- until now.</p>\n<p>After nine months away, a devastating injury, backstage drama that reportedly turned physical and a deluge of rumors about his future, CM Punk will return to AEW on Saturday night for its new weekly show \"Collision\" (TNT, 8 p.m. ET) at United Center in Chicago.</p>\n<p>Punk, whose real name is Phil Brooks, is no longer the AEW champion. Without saying why, AEW owner Tony Khan announced on the Sept. 7 episode of \"AEW Dynamite\" that the title had been vacated. Punk's name was not mentioned on AEW programming at all until very recently. No public statement was made about his whereabouts or his triceps injury for months. For those consuming only AEW's product and not any wrestling media, the entire situation was shrouded in mystery.</p>\n<p>\"I know pro wrestling is absolutely the most bizarre form of entertainment on Earth, but to me, I treat it like a business, and I treat it like the television show that it is,\" Punk told ESPN in his first interview since last September. \"So, y'all haven't seen me since I won the belt. I'm coming back. Tune in to find out exactly what I have to say. I'm picking up right where I left off.\"</p>\n\n\n<p>The absence was due to Punk tearing his left triceps tendon completely off the bone in the All Out match against Moxley, Punk said. The injury required surgery and a lengthy rehabilitation process. It was tough mentally, he said, because the injury was sustained in just his second match back after recovering from breaking his foot in June 2022. Punk said he's back to 100% now, and photos and videos on his Instagram have shown an impressive physique.</p>\n<p><alsosee></p>\n<p>\"I think, in wrestling, we always kind of joke how we always get hurt doing the dumb stuff,\" Punk said. \"Fall off a 15-foot ladder through a table and you're fine and you're running 6 miles the next day and you're in the gym. And then it's just always the dumb little things, like some routine thing that I've done a thousand times in my career, and it injures you. And then just the mental aspect of this recovery, it has not been easy. Luckily, I've got a really good support system, my wife [April Mendez, a three-time WWE divas champion under the moniker AJ Lee] and [dog] Larry, and I've got great friends and a super great rehab team that was able to get me back this quickly even though it doesn't feel -- it feels like it was 12 years ago.\"</p>\n<p>Aside from the recovery and rehab, the main reason the past nine months have felt so long is the many questions surrounding Punk's future in AEW and reports from media outlets such as the Wrestling Observer Newsletter, Fightful and PW Insider of backstage turmoil between Punk and AEW stars and executive vice presidents Kenny Omega and brothers Matt and Nick Jackson (the Young Bucks tag team). Omega, the Jacksons and \"Hangman\" Adam Page were among a group of wrestlers (that included <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/34024767/wwe-superstar-profile-cody-rhodes\">Cody Rhodes</a>, now of WWE) that helped launch AEW with Khan as the CEO in 2019. That group had been previously dubbed \"The Elite,\" which led to the branding of All Elite Wrestling. Punk signed with AEW in 2021 after a seven-year absence from the industry.</p>\n<p>In Punk's mind, the division started sometime in spring 2022. Previously, he said he felt as if he had a solid relationship with the group, including approaching Omega to ensure nothing Punk was doing in his matches would infringe on what spots Omega had planned and checking in on Page while he was sick with COVID-19.</p>\n<p>On May 25, 2022, Punk and Page were booked for a promo segment in the ring on Dynamite. Page was the AEW champion then, and Punk would be his challenger at the next pay-per-view event, Double or Nothing, four days later. Punk said he and Page discussed backstage before the segment what they would say, much as Punk said he did for similar segments in the past with wrestlers such as MJF and Eddie Kingston. But when they got into the ring, according to Punk, Page strayed from what they had agreed on.</p>\n<p>\"You talk a big game about workers' rights,\" Page said on television. \"Well, you've shown the exact opposite since you got here. I love this place, I care about this place. This is my home. And this Sunday at Double or Nothing, I will not be defending this championship against you. No, for the first time in my life, I'll be defending All Elite Wrestling from you.\"</p>\n<p>It was a bit confusing to most fans, especially the first part, since Punk's character was a babyface, a good guy, as was Page's. But to the naked ear, it just sounded like pro wrestling trash talk, part of the story. Punk said it was not that and confronted Page about it when they returned backstage.</p>\n\n\n<p>According to Punk, Page told him he said what he did because Punk had AEW wrestler and coach Colt Cabana fired from the company, or at least tried to. Punk and Cabana had a very public falling-out years ago, before Punk arrived in AEW, that included multiple lawsuits. Punk said he told Page that that was not true and that Cabana still worked for the company.</p>\n<p><photo2></p>\n<p>Cabana had been a mainstay on AEW YouTube shows and the Being The Elite YouTube vlog until March 2022. After March 4, 2022, Cabana didn't have another match for AEW in the United States until Nov. 2, 2022, and did not appear on Being The Elite for several months. Khan has said in multiple media appearances that Cabana's absence was because he was reassigned to work for the Ring of Honor wrestling promotion, which Khan purchased in March 2022. Cabana wrestled for ROH multiple times between March 2022 and November 2022, as well as on an overseas tour to promote AEW's video game.</p>\n\n\n<p>Punk told ESPN that he has no relationship with Cabana but that he \"never\" asked Khan to take Cabana's or anyone else's job. But others in the company, including the Elite, believe Punk did indeed do that, per sources. Page was evidently confident enough to bring it up unexpectedly on television.</p>\n<p>Khan and Page were unavailable to comment for this article, according to AEW. When reached for comment via email, Cabana said ESPN should go through AEW \"for everything.\" Omega and the Jacksons declined to comment via their agent Barry Bloom.</p>\n<p>Page's comments during the segment -- a \"shoot,\" in wrestling terms, meaning not a planned part of the show -- infuriated Punk. So much so that he considered not going through with the match out of concern that Page might intentionally attempt to hurt him. But Punk did go through with it and was booked to beat Page to win the AEW title on May 29, 2022.</p>\n<p>\"And I proceed to have what I think is a garbage match because I'm trying to protect myself on stuff instead of actually just working and trying to put on the best performance I can,\" Punk said. \"I'm keeping an eye out. He chopped me in the mouth one time, and I'm just like, 'OK, did you do that on purpose?' You chip my tooth, and I'm like, 'All right, should I give him a receipt?' It changes the dynamic. It poisoned everything for me, and it made it all really, really ugly, and that was what set all of this off, and here we are over a year later and ain't s--- been done about it.\"</p>\n\n\n<p>Three days after Double or Nothing, Punk broke his foot doing a crowd dive during his entrance. In his return to television Aug. 18, Punk called out Page during a segment in the ring without anyone knowing he would do it.</p>\n<p><inline1></p>\n<p>Things escalated after Punk beat Moxley in the All Out main event Sept. 4. Punk, known for being outspoken going back to his days in WWE and beyond, ripped into Page in the post-event news conference and accused Omega and the Jacksons of \"spreading lies and bulls---\" about him in the wrestling media. He said Omega and the Jacksons, all executive vice presidents in AEW, \"couldn't f---ing manage a Target.\" He also took aim at Cabana. Khan was next to him on the stage. Videos of the fiery news conference have been watched more than 1 million times on YouTube.</p>\n<p>Punk said he had regrets about what transpired in that media scrum and has since apologized to Khan for it. He said his and Khan's relationship is now \"great.\"</p>\n<p>\"The first thing I said to Tony when I sat down with him and spoke to him after it was, 'Man, I'm really sorry I put you in that position,'\" Punk said. \"I apologize for the scrum. But when you've watched that scrum, you're looking at a very, very frustrated guy who had told people. That's not the first time he heard all that. It's not the first time lawyers were told all that. And I was just looking for something to be done and nothing got done. So, if you want something done right, you got to do it yourself. And I just didn't approach it in the right manner, but tension was high. I was very, very pissed. I pretty much knew that I had just injured myself again. I was hurt, and I was disappointed. Yeah, it's very easy for me to say I regret that and I handled it the wrong way, 100%.\"</p>\n<p>After Punk left the news conference, there was a physical altercation involving Punk, his longtime friend and AEW producer Ace Steel, and Omega and the Jacksons, according to multiple reports. No one has discussed exactly what transpired, and Omega said on \"The Sessions\" podcast on March 1 that \"we can't say anything legally.\"</p>\n<p>AEW launched a third-party investigation with a law firm into the matter, which has since been completed, sources confirmed with ESPN. Khan announced on the Sept. 7 Dynamite that Punk's AEW World title and the AEW World Trios title, which Omega and the Young Bucks held, were vacated. Khan didn't mention their names, just that the titles no longer had champions. There was little to no mention of Omega and the Jacksons on AEW television again until November.</p>\n<p>Punk said that he doesn't like saying \"no comment\" but that \"we are trying to move past what happened that night specifically.\"</p>\n\n\n<p>\"I don't think what happened was a big deal...\" Punk said. \"This has happened in the last 10 months in hockey, in basketball, in baseball, in just about every sport. And it's covered and it's gone the next day. I think because I have injured my tricep and I've been out for so long, I think it has been exacerbated. I think it's been exacerbated by people spreading lies about the whole thing. And when, in reality, my attitude is, well, s--- happens.\"</p>\n<p>Omega said on \"The Sessions\" that what happened was a \"super big shame\" and \"a lot of people aren't going to ever know exactly how it went down\" or why or how it could have been prevented. He said thankfully no one was seriously injured and hopes other parties are \"doing well.\"</p>\n<p><photo3></p>\n<p>\"The important part is that I don't think anyone is happy that it happened or is proud that it happened or anything like that,\" Omega said. \"I think, across the board, everyone thinks it was a terrible situation that was unnecessary.\"</p>\n<p>Punk said he has not had any conversations with Omega or the Jacksons since the incident, although he has tried. He said when he has reached out, he has gotten \"messages from lawyers saying, 'Do not contact this person.'\" Punk said he is unclear whether those responses came at the request of legal representatives of Omega and the Jacksons or a third party.</p>\n<p>The pro wrestling industry has a history of leveraging real-life events and shaping them into future storylines, some of which have been very lucrative. Blending reality and fiction has been one of the art's core tenets, essentially a simulated sporting event or fight.</p>\n<p>Punk, though, said he had been told that using this saga on television and spinning it into some matches that would undoubtedly draw money won't happen. He resents that he's been painted as \"the bad guy\" in online reports when he feels he's just been defending himself. Punk said people in the AEW locker room leaking things to the wrestling media have contributed to the internal drama.</p>\n<p>\"Now we all got to roll in the f---ing mud, and that never should have happened and has never been course-corrected,\" Punk said. \"So, I understand people want to say that, 'Oh, man, Punk is a dick.' Well yeah, because I'm defending myself and I will always defend myself. I'm open to have a full-blown f---ing sit-down powwow discussion with everybody about it. But it hasn't happened yet, and it's not because of my lack of trying.\"</p>\n<p>At least for now, Punk will be featured on \"Collision,\" AEW's new show, while Omega, the Jacksons, Page and others will be on \"AEW Dynamite.\" Joining Punk on \"Collision\" will be up-and-coming wrestlers such as Ricky Starks and Powerhouse Hobbs, as well as established veterans such as Samoa Joe, Miro, Thunder Rosa and Andrade El Idolo. Punk said he's \"excited\" about a show with a lot of talent but will need to build some depth.</p>\n<p>\"With more TV time, you're only going to see guys like Hobbs and Starks, people who I think have the potential to do what an MJF [current AEW champion] has done with his television time but they haven't been able to be positioned because a guy like MJF gets a big lion share of television time, because he earned it,\" Punk said. \"We just need to do a better job of spotlighting so many different guys, and this is, for a lot of guys, sink or swim. Now it's just like, well, now's the time. You're going to have to really bust your ass and prove why we're giving you this spotlight and this TV time.\"</p>\n<p>Saturday hasn't been a big night for wrestling television in over two decades. There is a ton of competition in the sports world, from big UFC and WWE events to major college football. It'll be a fight for ratings every single week. In interviews, Khan said that TNT wanted more AEW programming and Saturday was the night selected.</p>\n<p>\"If I'm the poster boy -- top guy, whatever -- this is what people dream about,\" Punk said. \"You get put in a position like this and, you know, can't take the negative criticism. Personally, I look at it like a challenge. ... But as far as ticket sales for a Saturday night compare and contrast, I think it's a lot easier to move a Saturday night ticket to a live event than it is on a workday, on a Wednesday. So, there's positives and negatives, you know what I mean? And I don't look at the negatives as these huge detrimental things.\"</p>\n<p>AEW is only 4 years old and has already had great success as a competitor to WWE, which has ruled the pro wrestling world with few legitimate challengers for more than two decades. AEW has produced good ratings, pay-per-view buy numbers and ticket sales in a short amount of time. Per Khan, the promotion has already sold more than 65,000 tickets to its debut show in the United Kingdom, Aug. 27 at Wembley Stadium, and its next pay-per-view, a collaboration with New Japan Pro-Wrestling called Forbidden Door on June 25, is expected to be fully sold out in Toronto.</p>\n<p>A six-man tag team will headline the first \"Collision\" show Saturday, pitting CM Punk and AEW World Tag Team champions FTR against <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/4688808/jay-white\">Jay White</a>, Juice Robinson and Samoa Joe. Wardlow will defend his TNT championship against Luchasaurus.</p>\n<p>At no point, Punk said, did he consider not returning.</p>\n<p>\"I certainly had some low moments, and I won't rule out in those fleeting moments where I just say, 'Ah, f--- this, whatever,'\" Punk said. \"But I don't ever think it was a serious intention to say that I'm done. There's still work to do, and I think I'm excited about a lot of stuff that's coming up. So, to just throw the baby out with the bathwater, just because of a little boo-boo, I think would be a little silly.\"</p>\n<p>Nine months after stepping off the news conference stage in Hoffman Estates, Punk will be down the road in Chicago, his hometown, with an open forum yet again. The wrestling world will surely be waiting with bated breath.</p>\n<p>\"I won't know what I'm gonna do or say until I have that microphone in my hand,\" Punk said in a promo that aired Wednesday on \"AEW Dynamite.\" \"I have a lot of things to get off my chest.\"</p>\n\n\n\n\n",

And, one week later, on July 15, Moreno will be in his hometown taking part in a major lucha libre (Mexican professional wrestling) show.</p>\n<p>Lucha Libre AAA announced Thursday that Moreno will be appearing at Triplemanía XXXI in Tijuana, though not in a wrestling role. Moreno's manager Jason House of Iridium Sports Agency, confirmed the announcement with ESPN.</p>\n<p>Moreno will be acting as \"team captain\" of the Baja California team in an eight-man tag team match. The team will consist of Tijuana-area wrestlers Nicho Millonario (once known in WCW as Psicosis), Damian 666, Rey Horus and Xtreme Tiger. The Baja California team will face Team Chilango, consisting of Mexico City-area wrestlers Negro Casas, Chessman, Argenis and Daga. Team Chilango's celebrity team captain will be viral Mexican rap star Azcino.</p>\n<p>The main event of Triplemanía in Tijuana is a big one for wrestling fans. Rising superstar El Hijo Del Vikingo will defend his AAA Mega Championship against AEW's Kenny Omega, one of the top wrestlers in the world.</p>\n<p>Moreno, 29, is a two-time UFC flyweight champion and was the first Mexican-born champion in UFC history. AAA asked him to be on its Triplemanía show last year, but he could not attend because he was in training camp.</p>\n\n",

They are the best in the business.</p>\n\n\n<p>And yet, the list of wrestlers who would be considered must-see is gradually increasing, as a former champion (Mercedes Mone), a loudmouth (MJF) and best friends turned tag champs (Kevin Owens and Sami Zayn) are jamming their way onto the marquee.</p>\n\n\n<p>With Night of Champions (WWE), Double or Nothing (AEW) and other marquee shows coming up over the next few months, the time was right to bring back ESPN's pro wrestling rankings, as voted on by an internal panel.</p>\n\n\n<p>Our top male stars, female stars and tag teams in the world are ranked below with analysis from ESPN's wrestling correspondents Brandon Caldwell, Mike Coppinger and Marc Raimondi. This time, our writers will highlight stars who went from unranked in our September rankings to making our top five in May.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<h3>Charisma, style and a scowl: Ripley is more than her powerhouse strength</h3>\n\n\n<p><photo1></p>\n\n\n<p><b>Coppinger:</b> <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/31223052/wwe-profile-rhea-ripley\">Rhea Ripley</a> has quickly established herself as one of the most physically imposing forces in pro wrestling, not just among the women.</p>\n\n\n<p>Like Chyna before her, Ripley has more than held her own with whomever she shares the ring with, and it wouldn't be a surprise if she went on to win a men's title. Since she debuted with NXT UK in 2018, the Aussie has jumped off the screen with her superhuman strength, trademark scowl and powerhouse in-ring style.</p>\n<p><inline2-wide></p>\n\n\n<p>It didn't take long for Ripley to take over the women's division once she was called up to the main roster, winning the Raw women's championship at WrestleMania 37 with a victory over <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/20914188/wwe-profile-page-asuka\">Asuka</a>.</p>\n\n\n<p>One year ago, Ripley jumped to a new level when she joined The Judgment Day as its enforcer. With the brooding stable, she has been a part of some major storylines that extend far beyond the women's division. And her on-screen chemistry with<a href=\"https://www.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/29768294/wwe-profile-page-dominik-mysterio\"> Dominik Mysterio</a> as \"Mami\" is always entertaining TV.</p>\n\n\n<p>Ripley turned heads when she body slammed Luke Gallows -- billed at 6-foot-8, 291 pounds -- in October, and Triple H has done an excellent job building The Eradicator as a top heel. It's a matter of time until Ripley enters a singles program with one of the men; TV has consistently teased programs between Ripley, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/34918931/wwe-profile-page-solo-sikoa\">Solo Sikoa</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/17165433/wwe-profile-page-kevin-owens\">Kevin Owens</a>.</p>\n\n\n<p>She has been red hot since she linked up with <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/31223403/wwe-profile-damian-priest\">Damian Priest</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/17173285/wwe-profile-page-finn-balor\">Finn Balor</a> and Dominik, and Ripley rode that wave of momentum to a WrestleMania 39 victory over <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/17165125/wwe-profile-page-charlotte-flair\">Charlotte Flair</a> in a classic to capture the SmackDown women's championship.</p>\n\n\n<p><alsosee></p>\n<p>The win made Ripley just the fifth Women's Grand Slam Champion and youngest grand slam champion in WWE history (men's or women's). Ripley defended the title with a victory over <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/24394618/wwe-profile-page-zelina-vega\">Zelina Vega</a> earlier this month at Backlash, and at 26, continues to be one of WWE's fastest-rising stars.</p>\n\n\n<p>There's no limit to what Ripley can achieve. Between her excellent promos, cutting figure and innovative moveset, Ripley is one of WWE's top talents. Now, it's a matter of time before WWE delivers a storyline between Ripley and Sikoa that can push her to a different stratosphere.</p>\n\n\n<p>But before that, Ripley still has plenty of top stars to contend with on the women's side, from <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/17173527/wwe-profile-page-becky-lynch\">Becky Lynch</a> to <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/17171892/wwe-profile-page-bayley\">Bayley</a>. The biggest of them all: a showdown with <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/29125761/wwe-profile-page-bianca-belair\">Bianca Belair</a> for the undisputed women's championship.</p>\n<p><em>Others receiving votes: Giulia, Jamie Hayter, Deonna Purrazzo, Charlotte Flair, Tam Nakano, Trinity Fatu, Jordynne Grace, Iyo Sky, Kamille, Britt Baker</em></p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<h3>The American Nightmare is the franchise player he always knew he could be</h3>\n<p><photo2></p>\n\n\n<p><b>Caldwell:</b> <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/34024767/wwe-superstar-profile-cody-rhodes\">Cody Rhodes</a> has fans eating out of his hand in every arena. From his promos, a potent mix of Baptist preacher and Hollywood movie star, to his entrance theme, Rhodes has emerged as a bona fide superstar. When juxtaposed with <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/17122759/wwe-profile-page-sami-zayn\">Sami Zayn</a>, a beloved crowd favorite who helped carry WWE's best storyline, and fans calling for Zayn to main event WrestleMania and not him, Rhodes' star power never wavered.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The journey for Rhodes was always meant to return to WWE on his terms. By now, many know of him leaving the company in 2016 and famously returning at WrestleMania 38 in Dallas. It was a matter of reinvention for the second-generation star, who adopted elements of his father's bravado and showmanship and molded them in his image. Rhodes gravitated toward giving fans a story, whether as a thorn to the proverbial \"wrestling machine\" with AEW or holding the one prize his father never officially held: WWE champion. Fans bemoaned when Rhodes didn't defeat <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/17122948/wwe-profile-page-roman-reigns\">Roman Reigns</a> to \"finish the story\" of becoming champion, but Rhodes' path has always been about the long way around, not the short one.</p>\n<p><inline3-wide></p>\n\n\n<p>In AEW, Rhodes limited himself by ensuring he'd never challenge for the company's top prize after he feuded with <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/17598305/wwe-profile-page-brian-kendrick\">Chris Jericho</a>. Instead, he'd help build stars like Darby Allin and MJF. He made the late Brodie Lee's debut in the company memorable and elevated him to feel like a main event threat. Within the company he helped create, Rhodes established mainstays opposite him. Internally, the ultimate goal was returning to WWE as a fully realized version of himself, far different from the man who left six years prior.</p>\n<p><inline1></p>\n\n\n<p>Rhodes' return lasted all of three months. By April, he lived up to his billing as a man capable of a WrestleMania main event one day with <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/17165220/wwe-profile-page-seth-rollins\">Seth Freakin' Rollins</a>. By June, he was in the middle of a gruesome Hell In A Cell match with Rollins elevated by mind games from \"The Visionary\" and Rhodes' purplish chest, the result of a torn pectoral muscle suffered in a workout leading up to the match. Rhodes won the match, but he'd sit on the shelf for six months, rehabbing and promising the world he'd win the Royal Rumble and dethrone Reigns.</p>\n\n\n<p>Since his triumph at WrestleMania 38, Rhodes has only suffered one defeat -- the main event loss to Reigns at WrestleMania 39. He has reached an echelon of a beloved babyface, capable of being the ace of a company while simultaneously letting fans hang on to his every word and move within the ring. What Rhodes has cultivated by sheer force of imagination and belief is allowing a company, for the first time in ages, to have more than one suitable babyface to feel like a credible threat.</p>\n\n\n<p>In his eyes, once the lights go up -- Rhodes is home, and even when going through his version of the Odyssey to claim the top prize, he'll find comfort in being a franchise player, something he endured hard times to achieve.</p>\n<p><em>Others receiving votes: Jon Moxley, Sami Zayn, Will Ospreay, Kazuchika Okada, Hijo Del Vikingo, Bryan Danielson, Bobby Lashley, Gunther, Sanada, Trey Miguel</em></p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<h3>Aussie Open: From underground kings to mainstream heroes</h3>\n<p><photo3></p>\n\n\n<p><b>Raimondi:</b> Aussie Open isn't a new tag team. Mark Davis and Kyle Fletcher have been teaming up for around six years. They've been outstanding -- among the best in the world -- for a decent duration of that time. But now, what has been known among hardcore fans in the United Kingdom and Australia has been mainstreamed.</p>\n<p>Davis and Fletcher have been on a roll this year, especially in the last two months. Aussie Open won New Japan's IWGP Heavyweight Tag Team titles on Apr. 8 and then took the NJPW Strong Tag Team titles a week later.</p>\n<p><inline4-wide></p>\n\n\n<p>The former match, in Tokyo at NJPW Sakura Genesis against Bishamon (Hirooki Goto and YOSHI-HASHI), was one of this year's best tag team matches. Fletcher landed a moonsault from the top rope early on and cracked the back of his head on the guardrail, splitting it open. The visual itself was pretty absurd, since Fletcher is 6-foot-3. But even more absurd was he started bleeding from a gnarly cut in that area and had to be taped up during the match. He continued, and along with the hard-hitting Davis, showed out against New Japan's best tag team.</p>\n<p>The latter match, a title-winning three-way contest against two Japanese icons Kazuchika Okada and Hiroshi Tanahashi and the Motor City Machine Guns, is one of the top modern teams never to have performed in WWE. Aussie Open defended the IWGP titles for the first time against TMDK (Shane Haste and Mikey Nicholls) on April 29.</p>\n<p>Aussie Open, unfortunately, had to forfeit both of those titles Sunday night because of an injury to Davis. Fletcher made the announcement at NJPW Resurgence in Long Beach, California.</p>\n<p>This year, Davis and Fletcher also returned to AEW, having a terrific match against the Young Bucks on Feb. 22. They have also wrestled in Ring of Honor (ROH) several times over the past few months, certainly putting in those miles from Japan to the U.K. to the United States. Aussie Open participated in the multiteam ladder match during WrestleMania weekend for the Ring of Honor tag team titles at ROH Supercard of Honor, which also received critical acclaim.</p>\n<p>The best might be yet to come for the tandem. Fletcher will challenge Orange Cassidy for the AEW International title Wednesday on AEW Dynamite, the most high-profile singles match of his career. Fletcher is just 24 years old and is one of the best under-25 talents in professional wrestling. He and Davis also had strong singles showings in March during the New Japan Cup. Davis, nicknamed \"Dunkzilla,\" had excellent showings against Will Ospreay and SANADA during that tournament.</p>\n<p>Expect to see quite a bit more from Aussie Open in the U.S., once Davis returns from injury. It's a real bummer that they were likely to be on the AEW/NJPW Forbidden Door card on June 25 in Toronto against FTR in a rematch of an incredible match in the U.K. last October. If that happened, it would have stolen the show.</p>\n<p>Back in New Japan, Aussie Open was scheduled to defend their IWGP belts in a three-team match against Bishamon and House of Torture (EVIL & Yujiro Takahashi) at NJPW Dominion, the promotion's second biggest show of the year, on June 4 in Osaka. But now, with Aussie Open out, it'll just be a straight tag match for the vacant IWGP and NJPW Strong championships.</p>\n<p><em>Others receiving votes: Street Profits, Young Bucks, Motor City Machine, Lucha Bros, Damage CTRL, Ace Austin and Chris Bey, House of Black, The New Day, Raquel Rodriguez and Liv Morgan</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n",

        "story": "<p><video1> </video1></p>\n<p><strong>LAST MARCH, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/34024767/wwe-superstar-profile-cody-rhodes\">CODY RHODES</a></strong> was simply looking for closure.</p>\n\n\n<p>He set up a meeting with then-WWE chairman Vince McMahon and senior vice president Bruce Prichard to talk about what went wrong at the end of his tenure with WWE in 2016, his subsequent launching of rival promotion AEW and his public gripes about his former employer.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"I have such a respect for the George Lucas of our industry, that being Vince [McMahon],\" he said. \"And I just wanted to see them and talk to them. I was going to have that moment.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"And then everything changed.\"</p>\n\n\n<p>Rhodes wanted to apologize for the way he left the company, even though he felt justified in his decision. He'd been in the company for eight years and had yet to establish a main event role. He'd been feeling the strain of the Stardust character -- a take on his older half-brother Dustin's <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/17167218/wwe-profile-page-goldust\">Goldust</a> character -- who painted his face and carried himself like a comic book supervillain. Rhodes was getting lost behind the face paint.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"<a href=\"https://www.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/17165125/wwe-profile-page-charlotte-flair\">Charlotte Flair</a> introduced me to a little kid at a show once,\" he recalled. \"She told the kid 'That's Stardust.' But I wasn't in my Stardust get-up. And [the kid] was confused. When I said I used to be Cody Rhodes, he did not know who [that] was. I remember thinking 'We're in trouble.' I'd been in active [programs] with <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/17167409/wwe-profile-page-randy-orton\">Randy [Orton]</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/17122715/wwe-profile-page-triple-h\">Hunter [Triple H]</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/25685689/wwe-profile-page-rey-mysterio\">Rey [Mysterio]</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/17167514/wwe-profile-page-undertaker\">Undertaker</a>. Had I never gotten that taste, I would've not been in any pain. But it was like a drug that I could never get again. I knew there was a way to get back to it, but it was going to be by far the road less traveled.\"</p>\n\n\n<p><alsosee></p>\n<p>He also had the support, motivation and encouragement from his wife, Brandi.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"You're not a tree, so f---ing move,\" Brandi said at the time. \"There comes a breaking point where it's not worth proving something to anyone if you are beaten down to the ground by it. It was time to reset, rebrand and start over.\"</p>\n\n\n<p>Rhodes left on his own terms and was critical of the company. \"For a decade I tried to convince both Vince [McMahon] and Triple H that I could be their star player,\" he posted on social media. \"It seems we have reached the point where neither saw that in me. It's been said to never leave money on the table, but no money is worth being less than you are.\"</p>\n\n\n<p>Nearly seven years later, everyone sees what Rhodes always knew. He's redefined himself by channeling the wrestling and entrepreneurial spirit of his father and WWE icon, Dusty. From traveling the wrestling world, launching AEW to unexpectedly repairing his relationship with McMahon, Rhodes was unintentionally setting himself up for his WrestleMania moment.</p>\n\n\n<p>And on Sunday night in Los Angeles, he's going to get it.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<p><strong>RHODES' DEPARTURE FROM WWE</strong> provided him with a variety of opportunities. He had <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/19754826/cody-rhodes-american-nightmares-dream-come-true-ring-honor-new-japan-pro-wrestling\">a list of matches he wanted to have</a> and traveled the independent circuit. He wrestled in tiny venues like in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, to massive arenas like the Tokyo Dome. He built his name in organizations like Pro Wrestling Guerrilla and found a home on television with Impact Wrestling. That time away provided him with what he felt was missing.</p>\n<p>One talent Rhodes shares with his father is his mastery of the wrestling business. While Dusty was a superstar on camera in the 1980s, his storyline booking and innovation challenged the all-powerful McMahon. After all, Dusty's Starrcade set a blueprint for wrestling pay-per-views in America.</p>\n\n\n<p><photo2></p>\n<p>\"[The Rhodeses are] royalty just like the McMahons,\" said Diamond Dallas Page, WWE Hall of Famer. \"[They've] lasted a test of time too. Dusty was such an innovator. He made more careers than anybody.\"</p>\n\n\n<p>That generational gift showed itself in 2017 when wrestling journalist Dave Meltzer tweeted that Ring Of Honor wrestling -- one of the most popular indie companies in the world -- couldn't sell out a 10,000-seat arena. Rhodes took it as a challenge and bet that he and the popular tag team, The Young Bucks, could do it. The result: <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/23583170/all-young-bucks-cody-rhodes-ready-sold-all-event\">2018's All-In card in Chicago that sold out in minutes</a>, hitting that 10,000-seat mark easily.</p>\n\n\n<p>That one-off would lead to Rhodes' greatest contribution to the wrestling landscape while away from WWE in 2019, when he joined forces with some of the best independent wrestlers in the world -- The Young Bucks and Kenny Omega -- and Jacksonville Jaguars owner Tony Khan to form <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/25781334/cody-rhodes-all-elite-wrestling-origins-future-chris-jericho-path-aew\">All Elite Wrestling</a>. The company has become the first legitimate competitor to WWE in the 21st century. Not only has AEW allowed for an alternative to the behemoth WWE, but it also gives wrestling fans extra hours of programming each week.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"How many people could ever go off and go against the McMahon family?\" Page said. \"They did really good down there.\"</p>\n\n\n<p>But for Rhodes, a large part of the benefit comes from how AEW has helped increase earnings for everyone involved in wrestling.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"There's more money now in the business because me and my friends went out and started a rival promotion,\" he said. \"The money now in this business is through the roof.\"</p>\n\n\n<p>In February 2022, Cody left the company he worked so hard to build. He told Stone Cold Steve Austin on \"The Broken Skull Sessions\" that he felt the role of gatekeeper -- where he is the wrestler used to get young, newcomers over -- was becoming difficult. He wanted more. He wanted to stand out.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"I just didn't want to be a gatekeeper,\" he told Austin. \"I grew up in the business wanting to be the WWE champion, because it's the one that got away. This one got away from [Dusty], but I don't want it to get away from me.\"</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<p><strong>RHODES ANNOUNCED HIS</strong> departure from AEW, and the immediate speculation was that he was heading back to WWE. A couple of weeks after Rhodes left AEW, WWE started a storyline where former champion <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/17165220/wwe-profile-page-seth-rollins\">Seth Rollins</a> desperately sought an opponent for WrestleMania. It didn't take long for fans to connect the dots that the opponent Rollins would find would be a returning Rhodes. But that was all news to Rhodes, who hadn't even met with anyone at WWE yet. That meeting didn't take place until March.</p>\n\n\n<p>And when it happened, the conversation didn't go according to Rhodes' plan.</p>\n\n\n<p><photo1></p>\n<p>\"I wasn't going in there to sign,\" Rhodes remembers. \"And I left thinking, '<em>Are you about to sign?</em>'\"</p>\n\n\n<p>\"I really wanted the meeting to be about saying I'm sorry for [how I left],\" he said. \"I hope you guys are sorry about some things too. I wanted to hear that I was right about one specific thing: Stardust had run its course. Sometimes you need to see the destination for the journey. And that was something I wasn't getting from anybody.\"</p>\n\n\n<p>He also needed to make sure McMahon was clear on one thing: \"I told Vince McMahon I was the best wrestler in the world. I think I have been for a while. And he didn't argue with me about that.\"</p>\n\n\n<p>A few weeks later, he made <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/33646701/wrestlemania-38-night-1-live-recaps-analysis-ronda-rousey-faces-charlotte-flair-stone-cold-steve-austin-returns\">his return at WrestleMania 38</a>.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"He [was a] 30-year-old kid. Thirty-year-olds in our business, you're still a kid,\" Page said. \"You're making, I don't know, like half a million bucks a year, and you walk away from that because you believe you are not a big-card performer?</p>\n\n\n<p>\"The bottom line is he proved it so much, so they really wanted him back.\"</p>\n\n\n<p>The crowd's reaction told the story. Across eight hours of WrestleMania weekend events that saw the return of Austin, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/2335298/brock-lesnar\">Brock Lesnar</a> wrestling <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/17122948/wwe-profile-page-roman-reigns\">Roman Reigns</a> and an all-star match between <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/29125761/wwe-profile-page-bianca-belair\">Bianca Belair</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/17173527/wwe-profile-page-becky-lynch\">Becky Lynch</a>, Rhodes' return got arguably the loudest reaction.</p>\n\n\n<p>The 45-minute classic between Rhodes and Rollins was a showcase of all he learned while he was away. He and Rollins meshed an independent style of innovative high spots and near-falls with the dramatics and showmanship that translate to the biggest stage in all of wrestling.</p>\n<p><inline1></p>\n\n\n<p>\"The thing I was missing was a connection with the audience,\" Rhodes said. \"I didn't realize how important it is to connect with them. You can't do this amazing high-speed, unbelievable sequence if no one's watching. You gotta bring them into it and then you can do whatever the heck you want.\"</p>\n\n\n<p>Last April, WWE was struggling to find a suitable challenger for Roman Reigns, who had been dominating wrestling for two years. He had become so dominant that no possible contender seemed realistic. And overnight, Rhodes became that real threat. A shining babyface to usurp the Tribal Chief.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<p><photo3></p>\n<p><strong>THEN IT ALL </strong>fell apart. Literally.</p>\n\n\n<p>A few weeks after his WWE re-debut, Rhodes hit the gym for his routine weightlifting. Rhodes went to bench 295. As soon as the weights were off the rack, his right pectoral muscle ripped off the bone. A tear like that can keep wrestlers out for months. Rhodes was scheduled to <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/34039645/wwe-hell-cell-live-results-analysis-rhodes-rollins-3-two-title-matches-more\">main event Hell In A Cell</a> in another rematch with Rollins a few days later, and there seemed to be no way he could have the match.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rhodes wrestled anyway. In many ways, to prove to himself he could.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"What I thought was, 'maybe I don't have it,'\" he told <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/34935710/wwe-profile-page-logan-paul\">Logan Paul</a> on his ImPAULsive podcast last month. \"Maybe I don't have what John [Cena] has. That's why I was so adamant that we're not going to do some stupid thing backstage [to write me off in storyline]. Not knocking that. You should never wrestle in jest. I just wasn't going to have it any other way. I had to have the match at least.\"</p>\n\n\n<p>Rhodes ended the match as the hottest babyface in America -- a position his father held through much of the 80s. But he also ended the match needing to take months off at the height of his stardom. The lingering concern of 'What if I'm replaced while I'm out' lingered in his head.</p>\n\n\n<p>While Rhodes was recovering, Reigns and The Bloodline were putting together one of wrestling's most compelling stories. The slow burn of <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/17122759/wwe-profile-page-sami-zayn\">Sami Zayn</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/17173325/wwe-profile-page-jey-uso\">Jey Uso</a>'s tension with Reigns became one of the most emotionally resonant stories in wrestling history. Zayn could have realistically been Reigns' main event opponent. So could Uso. But as fans clamored for a Bloodline-centric Mania feud, Rhodes and the WWE creative team stayed the course.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"I wanted there to be a point where the audience decided,\" Rhodes said. \"And that's scary, but when you're a young wrestler you always get mad at other wrestlers doing well. But as you get older, it's like, oh, great, that's awesome. I didn't have a clue where it was ending or where it was going. But I knew there was going to be a positive. I knew the wave was coming for me.\"</p>\n\n\n<p>Rhodes made his return with a victory in the Royal Rumble. An hour later, the Zayn/Bloodline feud would reach its emotional high. At any moment, the wrong promo or the wrong crowd could turn on Rhodes for the Bloodline foils, who are at the front of everyone's minds. But it never happened.</p>\n\n\n<p>Crowds kept cheering for Rhodes. And when he needed to remind everyone that he was still coming for Reigns, Rhodes would say the right thing at the exact moment.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"I don't think there's a better talker in the business right now,\" says Page, who has known Rhodes his whole life. \"He's been that guy for a couple of years now. His old man could talk you into the building, and that's what Rhodes' doing. He's running on all cylinders right now.\"</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n<p><photo4></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>THREE WEEKS AHEAD</strong> of his WrestleMania match, before 75,000 fans cheer on Rhodes in Sofi Stadium, he's in the middle of a wrestling ring surrounded by six onlookers in a small gym about 30 miles southeast of Atlanta, in a town named McDonough.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rhodes is slammed by a skinny 22-year-old named Michael, who stands 5-foot-6. Michael, and the rest of the audience, are beginner students at Rhodes' Nightmare Factory wrestling camp. Rhodes is training with them in the ring, trusting a bunch of newbies to slam him and toss him less than a month before the biggest match of his life, where one wrong move or injury could put the biggest moment of his career in jeopardy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"It's stupid,\" he says with a laugh. \"But I love being in there with them.\"</p>\n\n\n<p>It's about passing on knowledge, something Dusty loved to do. For Rhodes, this moment ahead is where decades of backstories and histories can converge. That moment is when he walks through the curtain to try to win the championship that eluded his family for 50 years. In doing so, defeating one of the most dominant champions from one of the most iconic families in wrestling, proving he is the best wrestler in the world.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"Just to see the respect [Reigns] commands because of what he's done for WWE. I've never seen anything like it,\" said Rhodes of his opponent. \"Roman takes on that sense of royalty. That's really special because that's what's happening in Mania -- two families who really both want to leave with the title.\"</p>\n\n\n\n\n",

The cause of death was not released.</p>\n<p>The Delaware State Police announced Wednesday that Briscoe died in a head-on collision crash in Laurel, Delaware. The driver of the other vehicle also died, and Briscoe's two daughters, passengers in his truck, were injured. The cause of the crash is under investigation, police said.</p>\n<p>Briscoe, whose real name was Jamin Pugh, was an ROH tag team champion with his brother Mark. It was their 13th reign as champions in the promotion with which they were synonymous. The Briscoe Brothers' first reign happened in 2003, and Jay was on the first-ever ROH card in 2002.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"Sadly, Jamin Pugh has passed away,\" Khan tweeted. \"Known to fans as Jay Briscoe, he was a star in ROH for over 20 years, from the first show until today. Jay and his brother Mark dominated ROH, reigning as champions to this day. We'll do whatever we can to support his family. Rest In Peace Jamin.\"</p>\n<p>According to police, just after 5 p.m. local time Tuesday, a driver of a 2019 Chevrolet Silverado 1500, Lillyanne Ternahan, failed to remain in her lane, crossed the center line and entered the eastbound lane of the road. Pugh, who was not wearing a seat belt, was driving a 2016 Chevrolet Silverado 2500 heading east, and the two pickup trucks got into a head-on collision. Both drivers were pronounced dead on the scene, police said.</p>\n<p>Pugh's two daughters, 12 and 9 years old, were taken by ambulance to an area hospital and were admitted in critical condition, per police. Both were properly restrained in the vehicle, cops said. According to police, alcohol involvement in the crash is unknown, and no other vehicles were involved.</p>\n<p>Pugh, born in Maryland and a longtime resident of Sussex County, Delaware, was inducted into the ROH Hall of Fame last year and was a two-time ROH world champion. He also held titles in New Japan Pro-Wrestling and Impact Wrestling. The Briscoe Brothers are considered one of the best tag teams of all time to never perform for WWE.</p>\n\n\n<p>Last year, the Briscoe Brothers had some of the best matches anywhere in the world with AEW tag team FTR over the ROH tag team titles. The trilogy featured a regular match, a two-of-three-falls match and then a dog collar match. The Briscoes won the third contest to win back the belts.</p>\n\n\n\n\n",

With tons of options all over television and streaming, enthusiasts should have no problem finding what they like and sticking with it - or consuming every minute of action they can.</p>\n<p>This year, the outside-the-ring news overshadowed the exceptional work between the ropes.</p>\n<p>In June, WWE chairman and CEO Vince McMahon, the face and patriarch of the pro-wrestling industry for over three decades, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/34106615/vince-mcmahon-steps-aside-wwe-chairman-ceo-amid-investigation-alleged-hush-money-payment\">retired amid an investigation</a> into alleged misconduct. That came four months after McMahon, 77, performed in his final-ever match, against color commentator and wildly popular sports podcast host Pat McAfee at WrestleMania 38. After that match, McMahon was confronted by old rival \"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin, who gave him one last Stunner for old time's sake.</p>\n<p>With McMahon gone, the trio of Paul \"Triple H\" Levesque, Stephanie McMahon (Vince's daughter) and Nick Khan <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/34106615/vince-mcmahon-steps-aside-wwe-chairman-ceo-amid-investigation-alleged-hush-money-payment\">essentially took the company's reins</a>. Triple H, the former WWE champion and husband of Stephanie, has righted the ship creatively after McMahon's departure, and WWE business remains relatively strong.</p>\n<p><alsosee></p>\n<p>Not to be outdone, AEW also had drama in its third full year of existence. Just a year after his return from <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/32134255/cm-punk-returns-aew-all-story-why-cm-punk-came-back-professional-wrestling\">a seven-year layoff</a>, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/3962508/cm-punk\">CM Punk</a> reportedly got into a physical altercation with top wrestlers and executive vice presidents Kenny Omega and Matt and Nick Jackson, and the Young Bucks, following the All Out pay-per-view card in September. Punk, injured earlier in the night during his match, relinquished the AEW championship and has not been seen on screen since. Omega and the Young Bucks returned after a reported suspension last month.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, in WWE, Roman Reigns' incredible reign as Undisputed WWE Universal Heavyweight champion has continued, with Sami Zayn and Solo Sikoa joining the sublime Bloodline storyline with the Usos. Reigns' former Shield stablemate Jon Moxley bailed out AEW on several occasions with Punk injured, just months after <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/34132604/inside-aew-star-jon-moxley-battle-alcohol-addiction\">returning from rehab for alcoholism</a>, emerging as the most valuable wrestler in the promotion and a locker room leader.</p>\n<p>Marc Raimondi, Mike Coppinger, Greg Wyshynski and Brandon Caldwell look at the best performers in pro wrestling in an eventual 2022 campaign.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n<h2>Female wrestler of the year: Bianca Belair - 89%</h2>\n\n\n<p><photo2></p>\n<p>It's been an incredible evolution for Belair, going from a great athlete in development to a prospect to someone who lost her title in seconds at SummerSlam 2021 to a cornerstone of the WWE women's roster. That label can be raised even more now. Belair was arguably the best performer in the world in 2022, and the competition was steep.</p>\n<p>This isn't just about her long reign as WWE Raw women's champion, either. Belair took on all challengers and hurdled them like she was back on the track at the University of Tennessee. Her match against Becky Lynch was one of the highlights of a stacked WrestleMania 38, and they followed that up with a barnburner in a SummerSlam rematch. Later in the year, Belair and Bayley tore it down in a ladder match at Extreme Rules and an excellent Last Woman Standing match at Crown Jewel.</p>\n<p>Belair is an up-and-comer no longer. She's a full-fledged superstar. <em>-- Raimondi</em></p>\n<hr>\n\n\n<h2>Male wrestler of the year? Roman Reigns - 67%</h2>\n\n\n<p><photo3></p>\n\n\n<p>Reigns isn't just the biggest star in professional wrestling -- he's also amidst a historic championship run. The \"Head of the Table\" has held the WWE Universal Championship for well over two years, a title he should keep heading into WrestleMania 39, when he could meet The Rock in the main event.</p>\n\n\n<p><inline4></p>\n<p>Reigns isn't simply the chosen one; he's earned his place as the best men's wrestler in the world with a fresh character, a powerhouse wrestling style and much-improved promo skills that drive the organization's top storylines.</p>\n\n\n<p>His 2022 campaign has been buoyed by Sami Zayn, who injected The Bloodline with a dose of creativity, thus keeping Reigns and the faction from becoming stale. At 37, Reigns has developed into everything Vince McMahon could have hoped for when he ordained him as <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/34132604/inside-aew-star-jon-moxley-battle-alcohol-addiction\">the top star in WWE 10 years ago</a>. Reigns will go down as one of the greatest needle-movers of all time, and his work in '22 is a big reason why. <em>-- Coppinger</em></p>\n\n\n<hr>\n<h2>Tag team of the year: The Usos - 50%</h2>\n\n\n<p><photo4></p>\n\n\n<p>Tag team wrestling across the globe had a banner year in 2022, but no team became more decorated than The Usos. For years, Jimmy and Jey Uso argued they were part of a pantheon of great WWE tag teams. In 2022, they leaped above everyone to cement themselves as the best. Even as FTR nipped at their heels, winning titles across several promotions and feuding with The Briscoes, the Usos were undeniable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eclipsing Demolition and their rivals, The New Day, for the longest reign as tag team champions in company history was one thing. Routinely upping their game not only as a tag team but as an intricate part of wrestling's best storyline was another. From their instant classic with The Street Profits at Money In The Bank to their dramatic triumph over The New Day in November, the Usos made sure their twelfth year on the main roster outdid any other tag team -- and aim for even more in 2023. <em>-- Caldwell</em></p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<h2>Rookie wrestler of the year: Logan Paul - 39%</h2>\n\n\n<p><photo5></p>\n<p>It's OK to admit you were skeptical about Logan Paul. Who among us didn't wonder about a 27-year-old product of the creator economy, best known for controversial YouTube stunts and specious exhibition boxing matches, signing a multi-year deal with the WWE? While celebrities are usually asked to learn a few moves and are protected in tag matches, Paul was instead booked to face The Miz at SummerSlam and then undisputed champion Roman Reigns in the main event at November's Crown Jewel. That's a lot.</p>\n<p>That skepticism quickly dissipated when we saw <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/34942783/inside-logan-paul-quest-become-wrestling-superstar-wwe-crown-jewel\">what Logan Paul could do in the ring</a>, and the athleticism he exhibited in those matches -- like those splashes through tables, first on The Miz and then one on Reigns that Paul filmed himself performing in real-time, to viral acclaim. Shane \"Hurricane\" Helms, his WWE trainer, praised Paul's capacity for learning the craft and his humility.</p>\n\n\n<p>Now, if only the WWE would do the right thing and pull the trigger on a Logan Paul heel run... <em>-- Wyshynski</em></p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<h2>Breakthrough wrestler of the year: Ricky Starks - 28%</h2>\n\n\n<p><inline1></p>\n\n\n<p>The choice for the biggest breakthrough star in 2022 is \"Absolute.\" After a broken neck stalled his progress in 2021, the 32-year-old Starks worked his way back to prominence as the FTW champion and part of AEW's Team Taz early this year. He was always solid as part of the heel faction, including a great showing in a triple-threat tag match with Powerhouse Hobbs at Double of Nothing in May. Still, he started to create magic when he turned babyface over the summer with an inspiring promo.</p>\n<p>The always meticulously dressed Starks beat Hobbs, who turned on him, in an unsanctioned match at Grand Slam. Then, the New Orleans native won the annual AEW championship eliminator tournament and the Dynamite Diamond Ring battle royal to set up a title match with the new champion MJF. Leading into that bout earlier this month, Starks and MJF engaged in one of the best promo battles of the year, with the cocky-yet-relatable Starks arguably getting the better of MJF, the current best promo guy in the business. <em>-- Raimondi</em></p>\n\n\n<hr>\n<h2>Promo artist of the year: MJF - 72%</h2>\n<p><inline2></p>\n\n\n<p>Speaking of the best promo guy in the business, it's not always about what Maxwell Jacob Friedman says, it's the anticipation of what he might say. Will he call his boss \"a mark\" and beg to be fired? Will he openly boast about leaving for the competition when his contract is up? Will he pit <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/34942783/inside-logan-paul-quest-become-wrestling-superstar-wwe-crown-jewel\">pro wrestling fans against UFC fans</a>? Will he discuss a childhood photo of himself and an opponent to make it part of their storyline? Will he insult the fans, or say something to earn their adoration and then make a mockery of them again?</p>\n<p>MJF did all of this and more in 2022, as he won the AEW world championship for the first time. His promos weren't all instant classics -- we could go without him trolling the fans about bolting for the WWE in 2024, as that's now the cheapest of heat -- but they were always captivating. It's sometimes hard to remember that the Burberry-scarfed miscreant is only 26 years old when you see him match a master of the promo arts like William Regal word-for-word. Then again, that's why he's MJF. He's better than you. And you know it. <em>-- Wyshynski</em></p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<h2>Match of the year: Sheamus vs. Gunther, Clash at The Castle - 33%</h2>\n\n\n<p><photo6></p>\n\n\n<p>A brutal, hard-hitting match -- especially by WWE standards -- Gunther's win over Sheamus in September restored some much-needed prestige to the oft-ignored Intercontinental Championship.</p>\n\n\n<p>There were many contenders for this award, but this match stood out above the rest for its physicality and striking between two of the stiffest workers in wrestling. Adding to the action was an incredible atmosphere: 60,000 plus packed Principality Stadium in Cardiff, Wales, to cheer on Ireland's Sheamus, who was looking to become a Grand Slam champion.</p>\n\n\n<p>Over 20-plus minutes, Gunther and Sheamus punished each other with a series of open-palm slaps and knife-edged chops in a bout that took them to the ring apron, announcer table and the crowd.</p>\n\n\n<p>NXT has repeatedly featured this sort of violent match, but such is rare on WWE's main roster. Perhaps it was a harbinger of things to come in the Triple H era. <em>-- Coppinger</em></p>\n\n\n<hr>\n<h2>Best PPV event of the year: AEW x NJPW: Forbidden Door - 28%</h2>\n\n\n<p><inline3></p>\n<p>AEW received quite a bit of criticism for the build-up to its first co-promotional show with New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW). Japanese wrestlers appeared on AEW's weekly Dynamite show cold with little introduction, causing those who don't follow wrestling in that part of the world to cry foul. Part of the issue was that the main event was supposed to pit then-AEW champion CM Punk against NJPW uber-babyface legend Hiroshi Tanahashi, but Punk broke his foot and had to pull out of the match. Jon Moxley replaced him.</p>\n<p>While the leadup was uneven, Forbidden Door delivered enormously. It was a good lineup on paper, and it exceeded expectations. Moxley vs. Tanahashi was excellent, as was a match between Claudio Castagnoli and Zack Sabre Jr. But a dramatic, back-and-forth, athletic affair between Will Ospreay and Orange Cassidy completely stole the show. The pre-show was even strong, highlighted by an unforeseen banger between the team of Chris Jericho, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/2502013/minoru-suzuki\">Minoru Suzuki</a> and Sammy Guevara and the team of Eddie Kingston, Shota Umino and Wheeler Yuta. <em>-- Raimondi</em></p>\n\n\n<hr>\n<h2>Best storyline of the year: The Bloodline and Sami Zayn</h2>\n\n\n<p><photo7></p>\n<p>The Bloodline is as dominant a faction as we've seen in wrestling. Reigns is the undisputed world champion. And his cousins, theUsos, are the undisputed tag team champions. All of them have held their titles for record amounts of time. But dominance can get stale without a storyline. Thus making the creative addition of Zayn to the group one that managed to elevate a group that was already flying high.</p>\n<p>To call Zayn one of the WWE's most unique talents would be an understatement. How many wrestlers can put on championship-level matches but also thrive in a WrestleMania gimmick battle against the cast of \"Jackass,\" one that ended with him pinned in a giant mousetrap? He can work, he can talk and he has a gift for understanding what the moment needs.</p>\n<p>His interaction with The Bloodline started after that Johnny Knoxville feud, as Zayn sought credibility through an association with Reigns and Co. In May, the Head of The Table made him an \"Honorary Uce\" and an ancillary member of the group. By September, he was \"an Official Honorary Uce\" and a more engrained part of the group, which had now added Solo Sikoa, the Usos' younger brother.</p>\n<p>Zayn's time with The Bloodline featured tension with a jealous Jey Uso and some promos where Zayn's natural comedic talents brought his super serious stablemates to the point of breaking. All of it points to an inevitable moment where The Bloodline will turn on their \"Honorary Uce\" to ignite a major face turn. The emotional investment from fans is so intense that some have suggested, without irony, that Zayn should finally take the title off of Reigns at a WrestleMania main event.</p>\n<p>Such is the power of this angle, the best of 2022. <em>-- Wyshynski</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n",

        "story": "<p><photo1></p>\n<p>Professional wrestling's brightest up-and-coming star has been butting heads with one of the top prospects in MMA on social media -- and it could turn into a real-life confrontation.</p>\n<p>After a social media encounter with rising UFC fighter <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/4008549/paddy-pimblett\">Paddy Pimblett</a>, AEW world champion Maxwell Jacob Friedman (better known as MJF) told ESPN he is considering confronting Pimblett on his next fight night. Pimblett fights <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/3894823/jared-gordon\">Jared Gordon</a> on December's UFC 282 main card.</p>\n<p>\"I wouldn't be shocked if the AEW world champion shows up on Dec. 10 in Vegas,\" MJF said.</p>\n<p><alsosee></p>\n<p>The beef started when Pimblett, nicknamed \"The Baddy,\" <a href=\"https://twitter.com/The_MJF/status/1595104915851968512\">commented on an MJF interview video clip</a> on Instagram. In that clip, MJF talked about how dangerous professional wrestling is, calling it even riskier than MMA. Though pro wrestling is obviously pre-determined, the punishment to athletes' bodies is very real, while MMA is a legit, mixed-rules fight.</p>\n<p>Pimblett, and several other MMA fighters such as former UFC lightweight champion <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/4303044/eddie-alvarez\">Eddie Alvarez</a>, commented on the Instagram video. Pimblett called MJF a clown, with some expletives mixed in, and MJF went back at him with insults.</p>\n<p>\"I'm sick and tired of people talking about pro wrestling as if it's some f---ing stunt show,\" MJF, 26, told ESPN. \"The fact of the matter is Paddy 'The Prima Donna' Pimblett would not last two seconds in a professional wrestling ring with me. Maybe not even one.\"</p>\n<p>MJF, who mocked the pronunciation of Pimblett's last name throughout the ESPN interview, said pro wrestlers get chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), have been paralyzed from the neck down and even killed during matches, with the latter two not happening very much in mixed martial arts.</p>\n<p>\"This fat, moon-faced prick, Will-from-Stranger-Things-looking a--hole dollar store <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/3022677/conor-mcgregor\">Conor McGregor</a> decided he needed to chirp up and say, 'Oh, wrestling is fake,'\" MJF said. \"Let me tell you something. We are real fighters. They are prima donnas.\"</p>\n<p>Pimblett is 3-0 in the UFC with three finishes and has a massive fan base with over 2 million followers on Instagram. MJF just won the AEW title last Saturday night, beating Jon Moxley at the Full Gear pay-per-view.</p>\n<p>MJF, who is from Long Island, New York, said he could confront Pimblett in Las Vegas next month, but \"is Paddy the Baddy even worth my time?\" If not, MJF said Pimblett should meet him next year when AEW goes to London. Pimblett is a Liverpool, England, native.</p>\n<p>\"Pro wrestling is a dangerous, dangerous sport, and there is no one more dangerous than MJF,\" Friedman said. \"I can assure you when we come to London in 2023, if Paddy shows his face, he's going to find out that a Scouser [a native or inhabitant of Liverpool, England] is no match for a Long Islander. Because I'm better than him and he knows it.</p>\n<p>\"There's a target on my back at all times. Like I said, if 'Paddy the Baddy' thinks he can aim at that target and hit it, I am more than game. More than game to knock that guy out.\"</p>\n\n\n\n\n",
