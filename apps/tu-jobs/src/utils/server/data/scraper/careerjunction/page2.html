                                        minimum period of time as may be determined by the Company
                                        at our discretion. This is to ensure that jobseekers who receive
                                        your job advertisements by email will not find a job to have
                                        expired during that timeframe. The Company retains the right
                                        to amend the minimum live duration required in respect of jobs
                                        advertised on the Website.

                                        Each job may be advertised once only. Posting duplicate or
                                        similar job advertisements that relate to the same job provides
                                        unrealistic search results and is deeply frustrating for
                                        jobseekers. Advertisement of the same job twice, at the same
                                        time, is prohibited, including where the description of the job is
                                        changed or rephrased.

                                    <li>We will collect and use your Identity, Contact and Profile Data to provide

                                        of Use) with you. Details of your application for a Job Specification will only
                                        ever be shared with the Customer advertising the role. It will never be shared
                                        with any other Customer.</li>

                                        to a vacant position. This matching will be based on a profile of the job

                                        based on the job specifications you have interacted with in the past 45 days.
                                        This is necessary for our legitimate interest to ensure that Website content is

                                        you have interacted with in the past 45 days. This is necessary (i) in order for

                                        application form. As Job Alert emails are personalised to you, it is important
                                        that you do not share these email links with other people or post them on social
                                        media. You are responsible for maintaining the security of these personal Job
                                        Alert email links. Sharing personalised Job Alerts could result in somebody

                                    Economic Area (“EEA”) or transferred to, stored in, and accessed from countries
                                    outside the EEA in order to fulfil the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.
                                    For transfers to countries outside the EEA, the data protection regime may be
                                    different than in the country in which you are located and will therefore be based
                                    on a legally adequate transfer method. Whenever NIjobs.com transfers your personal
                                    data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is given to it by
                                    ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented: </p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>Where the country has been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for
                                        personal data by the European Commission. For further details, see European
                                        Commission: Adequacy of the protection of personal data in non-EU countries.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>We may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give
                                        personal data the same protection it has in Europe. For further details, see
                                        European Commission: Model contracts for the transfer of personal data to third
                                        countries.</li>
                                    <li>Where service providers are based in the US, we may transfer data to them if
                                        they are part of the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield which requires them to provide
                                        similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the US. For
                                        further details, see European Commission: EU-US Privacy Shield. </li>

                                <p>We will provide you on request a list of the countries located outside the EEA to
                                    which personal data may be transferred, and an indication of whether they have been
                                    determined by the European Commission to grant adequate protection to personal data.
                                    Where applicable, you are entitled, upon request to receive a copy of the relevant
                                    safeguard (for example, EC model contractual clauses) that has been taken to protect
                                    personal data during such transfer.</p>

                                <h2>Data retention</h2>

                                <p>We retain personal data for no longer than is allowed under data protection law and,
                                    in any case, no longer than such personal data is necessary for the purpose for
                                    which it was processed. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal
                                    data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the
                                    potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure, the purposes for which
                                    we process personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other
                                    means, and the applicable legal requirements.</p>
                                <p>As a registered user of the Website we will retain your Identity, Contact, Profile,
                                    Technical, Usage, Marketing and Communications Data for as long as your user account
                                    is live. We retain the personal data you provide while your account is in existence
                                    or as needed to provide you access to the Website and any NIjobs.com Service you
                                    have used. Even if you only use the Website or any other NIjobs.com Service
                                    occasionally, we will retain your Identity, Contact, Profile, Technical, Usage,
                                    Marketing and Communications Data until you decide to close your user account. In
                                    some cases we retain certain Usage Data (e.g. visitor and application statistics in
                                    a depersonalized or aggregated form). Also, we retain personal data for longer if
                                    required by applicable law or regulation or justified under applicable statutory
                                    limitation periods.</p>
                                <p>If you respond to a Job Specification, publish your CV/resume on our CV Database or
                                    otherwise communicate with Customers via the Website a copy of your job application,
                                    CV/resume and a record of the communication will be held the Customer’s user
                                    account. The copy of your job application CV/resume and record of communication will
                                    remain on the Customer's user account for no more than 18 months after the job
                                    specification has been archived. We will delete that copy of your application
                                    CV/resume and record of communication from the Customer’s user account 18 months
                                    from the date the job specification is archived, unless you have exercised
                                    <strong>Your Legal Rights</strong> of erasure of that personal data before this.
                                    Details of all the job applications you make through the Website can be viewed by
                                    you in Your Account.</p>

                                <h2>Your legal rights</h2>

                                <p>Under certain circumstances you have rights under applicable data protection law in
                                    relation to personal data, namely:</p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Request access to your personal data</strong> (commonly known as a "data
                                        subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal
                                        data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you.</strong>
                                        This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you
                                        corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide
                                        to us.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Request erasure of your personal data.</strong> This enables you to ask
                                        us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us
                                        continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove
                                        your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to
                                        processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully
                                        or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law.
                                        Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of
                                        erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable,
                                        at the time of your request.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Object to processing of your personal data</strong> where we are relying
                                        on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something
                                        about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on
                                        this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You
                                        also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for
                                        direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have
                                        compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your
                                        rights and freedoms.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Request restriction of processing of your personal data.</strong> This
                                        enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the
                                        following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data's accuracy; (b)
                                        where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c)
                                        where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need
                                        it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to
                                        our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate
                                        grounds to use it.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party.</strong>
                                        We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in
                                        a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only
                                        applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to
                                        use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Withdraw consent</strong> at any time if and to the extent we are
                                        relying on consent as the legal basis to process your personal data. However,
                                        this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you
                                        withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to
                                        provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the
                                        case at the time you withdraw your consent.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>Regarding your right to have your personal data erased, you can delete your user
                                    account with NIjobs.com at any time. Deleting your user account deletes records of
                                    job applications sent, CVs and cover letters stored in your account, your profile,
                                    saved jobs and job alerts. Once your user account is deleted, it is gone forever and
                                    cannot be restored. Some personal data however may still be stored and visible in
                                    other places on the Website. For example, if you have applied for a job, your
                                    application information including your name, email, CV and cover letter may still be
                                    visible to the Customer in their user account on the Website. We will endeavor to
                                    contact Customers we know who have accessed your personal data within the previous
                                    18 months and inform them of your request to erase your personal data.</p>
                                <p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of
                                    the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is
                                    clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply
                                    with your request in these circumstances. We may need to request specific
                                    information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to
                                    access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a
                                    security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has
                                    no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information
                                    in relation to your request to speed up our response.</p>
                                <p>In order to exercise one or more of your rights in respect of your personal data, you
                                    can do so from the Account Settings option in Your Account on the Website.
                                    Alternatively, please contact us at gdpr@NIjobs.com. We will respond to your
                                    request(s) as soon as reasonably practicable, but in any case within the legally
                                    required period of time.</p>
                                <p>You have the right to make a complaint at any time to the Data Protection Commission,
                                    the Irish supervisory authority for data protection issues (<a
